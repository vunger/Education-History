            <head TEIform="head">FOREWORD</head>

            <p TEIform="p">In publishing a series of historical studies such as this the University
               is undertaking a task entirely new in its history of something approaching a hundred
               and sixty-five years. Through this present pioneer effort, and later volumes to come,
               it is hoped to make a valuable contribution to the cultural life of the Province in
               general and to the cause of education in particular.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">It may appear to some readers an ambitious project for a relatively small
               university to attempt to develop a school of graduate research. There are, however,
               many considerations to justify it. The standard of undergraduate study is raised and
               the whole intellectual life of the university quickened. Projects conducted with
               patience, ability and honesty of purpose, as this effort has been, will be of great
               value to the community at large. The post-graduate students engaged in the research
               derive special benefits from the undertaking. I believe that it is fitting and proper
               that the University should promote and encourage such work, even though its primary
               role must continue to be the education of our youth on the undergraduate level.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">This book is the first concise survey of the background of education in
               this Province based upon a wide use of the data available. It should be an
               inspiration as well as a warning for the future. It makes clear that the ambitions
               and aspirations of the period were not always faithfully reproduced in the quality
               and character of the educational facilities that came into being.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">While reading this book it is easy enough for us to pause and speculate
               upon what might have been. One can wonder what New Brunswick might be today if, in
               the early nineteenth century, a consistent and progressive policy of economic and
               educational development, no matter how modest, had been established and adapted to
               the changing scene down through the years. We can look back and say that the
               educational system should have been designed to prepare New Brunswick's young people
               to a greater degree for participation in the cultural and economic growth of the
               Province, thereby enriching it by the full expression of their spirit and enterprise.
               Instead the story tells of a constant need for greater financial support, of
               conflicting objectives, and of the frustration of many noble efforts. One result was
               the trend, often referred to as the <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q"
                  >export of brains</q>, but which in reality was a continued drainage from the
               Province of its youth seeking opportunities for self-expression and livelihood
               elsewhere. All this we can think, and more, as we scan the pages that follow, but we
               must remember all the intricate difficulties which characterized the period covered
               and, so remembering, we should recognize and build upon the solid progress that was
               achieved. Speculation concerning what might have been is justified only if it causes
               us to work with vision, energy, and a buoyant faith for the future. I feel confident
               that Miss MacNaughton's excellent study of the past will be very helpful in this
               task.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">I wish to acknowledge the devoted labour of Dr. A. G. Bailey, Head of <pb
                  n="ii" id="pii" TEIform="pb"/> the Department of History of the University, whose
               conception of the University's obligations to the community has included an untiring
               search for source material and the production of a series of monographs on provincial
               subjects of which this is the first, and without whose able supervision, this work
               would never have been begun and could not have been produced.</p>

            <head TEIform="head">INTRODUCTION</head>


            <p TEIform="p">The notable achievements of Canadian historians in the fields of
               political, and economic history have served to establish a framework within which the
               task of the social and cultural historian may be conceived and performed. Yet the
               writing of an adequate general monograph in this field is hardly yet possible, for
               the lack of numerous special studies of particular phases upon which the general
               historian must depend as groundwork for his task of synthesis and interpretation. In
               this respect, and for discernible reasons, Canadians have lagged behind their
               contemporaries in Great Britain and the United States where the minute investigations
               of countless scholars have prepared the way for the brilliantly integrated studies
               that have for some years issued from the presses of those countries.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">Because of this dearth of special studies, and in view of the fact that
               for a long period the cultural life of each of the provinces was to some extent
               separate and peculiar, although they drew much from a common source, and interacted
               upon each other, the most reasonable approach to the problem would seem to be through
               the production of series of provincial histories of beliefs, attitudes, and
               institutions, in such fields as education, religion, science, and literature, each
               conceived in its just relation to the total configuration. This appears to be the
               next great task to which Canadian historians should devote themselves, and it has
               been with a view to making some contribution towards it that the studies, of which
               this is the first, have been undertaken. The task should be congenial in view of the
               increasing concern of Canadians to recognize the marks of their own national
               identity. Although some progress has been made towards the achievement of such
               recognition, it is not yet possible to delineate the Canadian character with any high
               degree of precision, partly because an examination of the popular attitudes and
               beliefs that inform Canadian institutions, and that find, or fail to find, expression
               in Canadian social and cultural life, has only begun to be made. It might well be
               that such studies in social and cultural history, as have here been suggested, would
               yield a knowledge of certain persistent traits In Canadian life which, when
               recognized, would provide answers to many of the questions that now baffle the
               student of Canadian society. In that sense these studies are adventures in national
               self-discovery.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">While our primary interest may be in the solution of contemporary
               problems, it is assumed that these problems must necessarily be approached
               historically. This point of view may be justified on two grounds. First, whatever
               else history may be, it still seems reasonable to regard it, although not in the
               eighteenth-century sense, as <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q"
                  >philosophy teaching by example</q>. In the second place, although past, present,
               and future are necessary concepts, they constitute a continuous process and, in a
               sense, do not exist as separate entities. It is therefore of value, if indeed it is
               not imperative, to regard the <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q"
                  >past</q> as the <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">present</q> and
                  <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">future</q> in a state of
               becoming. If history is a continuum it follows that the <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">present</q> conditions result, in a casual
               relationship, from <pb n="iv" id="piv" TEIform="pb"/>
               <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">past</q> conditions, and if we are
               to understand things as they are, and anticipate what they are likely to be, we must
               appreciate the causes that have made them so. The greater our knowledge, the more
               effectively may we control the conditions that mould our lives. A study of the past
               fortifies us against the contingencies of the future. In planning this and other
               studies in the series these considerations have been borne in mind.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">Although all knowledge is the province of a university, it has been
               assumed that the Provincial University should include among its concerns a study of
               the forces that have shaped the life of the community of New Brunswick which it was
               so largely established to serve. It would be recreant to its high calling as a
               disseminator of <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">useful
                  knowledge</q> if it remained indifferent to the reactions of its people to the
               exigencies of the physical and social environments, which they must meet with a firm
               will and an enlightened understanding if they are to realize the ends of a rational
               society on their own terrain. It is not our purpose here to specify the problems
               which might best be solved through provincial, national, or international action, nor
               is it intended that these studies should foster a parochial outlook. The
               anthropologist who pursues his legitimate task of studying the culture of a primitive
               tribe or area preserves a spirit of detachment and does not become a party to the
               tribal mores which he is engaged in recording. The concept of culture as regional has
               been useful in the field of ethnology. Likewise the impact of historic forces has had
               a regional incidence in New Brunswick, the most conspicuous of which have been those
               industrial and political processes that have produced that state of <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">chronic depression</q> so ably analyzed and
               described by recent economists. Yet it would be a mistake to regard man as entirely a
               passive object of blind and capricious forces, and although Mr. Arnold Toynbee does
               not write hopefully of this eastern region, students of his great work will be
               familiar with the fact that time and again throughout history men have successfully
               responded to the challenges of hard ground and penalization by redirecting their
               creative energies into possible channels leading to fruitful ends. It would be tragic
               if an ever-deepening taedium vitae resulted from the revelation of the adverse forces
               that impinge upon and affect the course of life in this area. If the problem were
               construed too narrowly in terms of natural resources there might be danger of
               neglecting to husband the human resources that must be brought to bear upon the
               problem of rebuilding society on surer foundations. In supplementing the work of
               students in related fields, these historical studies are intended to contribute to
               the accomplishment of that purpose by providing a basis for discussion which it is
               hoped will create an intellectual ferment without which there can be little hope of
               progress towards the realization of a better life for all. </p>

            <p TEIform="p">While several studies have been made in the field of New Brunswick
               education, no comprehensive or detailed history of the educational development of the
               province, based upon extensive archival research, has been published, nor so far as I
               am aware, has such a history been written. Certainly no attempt has been made to set
               developments in New Brunswick education against the social political, and economic
               background of the province, or to relate them to the wider field of educational
               movements in Britain, Europe, the United States, and other parts of British North
               America. For this reason the present work, in which such an attempt has been made,
               may be of some interest to the student of the history of ideas and institutions.
               While possibly of primary concern to the people of New Brunswick, it will, I hope,
               make some contribution to the cultural history of Canada.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">Research into the manuscript, newspaper, book, and pamphlet collections
               contained in many of the archives and libraries of eastern Canada has enabled me to
               give a more comprehensive account of the flow of educational ideas and intellectual
               changes than would have been possible if the material used had been confined to the
               obvious printed sources. The subject has not been conceived as a succession of
               anecdotes or biographies, but rather as an aspect of a developing society treated in
               its relation to a general social and cultural context. Consequently no attempt has
               been made to enlarge upon the lives and personalities of educational officials,
               except in the cases of Marshall d'Avray and Theodore Rand who were responsible for
               inaugurating changes and determining policy in the two most crucial periods in the
               history of the province. The influence of the New England States, and the general
               significance of regionalism have been suggested whenever possible. I am well aware of
               many defects and deficiencies, for some of which I plead exigencies of time and
               space. The lack of an index is a serious omission, but the detailed table of contents
               will, I trust provide a useful substitute.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">I acknowledge gratefully the financial assistance of a fellowship at the
               University of New Brunswick which has made possible the writing of this master s
               essay, and I express my warmest appreciation to the Campbellton School board for
               their generosity in granting me two years leave of absence from my teaching position.
               I am grateful to the staff of the Public Archives of Canada, particularly to Miss
               Norah Storey; to Miss Estelle Vaughan and the other members of the staff of the Saint
               John Free Public Library; to Dr. J. Clarence Webster, C. M. G., and to Miss Margaret
               Evans of the New Brunswick Museum for the courtesy with which they facilitated my
               research work. To Mrs. M. J. Thompson, Librarian at the University of New Brunswick,
               and to the entire library staff of the University, I am deeply indebted for the more
               than ordinary facilities which they placed at my disposal. Miss Louise Manny of
               Newcastle not only gave me encouragement but she and Dr. Lilian Maxwell generously
               offered the use of valuable material in their possession. Dr. A. S. MacFarlane, <pb
                  n="vi" id="pvi" TEIform="pb"/> until recently the Chief Superintendent of
               Education and Dr. Fletcher Peacock, Director of Educational Services and Chief
               Superintendent of Education of New Brunswick, co-operated in every way in my search
               for material at the Education Office. The Honorable J. B. McNair, Premier of the
               province, and Mr. Justice Bacon Dickson, until recently the Deputy Attorney General,
               readily placed at the disposal of the Department of History of the University
               archival material In the vault of the Executive Council. Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin
               Company of Boston, have kindly given me permission to quote from Professor D. G.
               Creighton's brilliant interpretation of Canadian history, <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">Dominion of the North</q>. To these, and to those
               others who assisted me in various ways, I express my sincere thanks.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">My greatest debt is to Dr. A. G. Bailey, head of the Department of
               History of the University of New Brunswick. But for his faith this book would not
               have been begun, and without his encouragement and assistance it could never have
               been completed. In that sense it belongs to him as well as to me. I must, however,
               bear final responsibility for any faults which may be found in the work. I am
               grateful also to Miss Frances Firth, of the Department of History, for her assistance
               in reading the proofs.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">Whether the founders of the province of New Brunswick left the American
               Colonies because of love for king and royal traditions, or whether loyalty was only
               the basis of the cause of their exodus, and not the cause itself,<note target="n1.1"
                  anchored="yes" TEIform="note"><hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">1</hi></note> an
               examination of the institutions to which they adhered, the traditions which they
               cherished, and the political and cultural ideals of the country with which their
               connections were strengthened is an integral part of any study of the early history
               of the province.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">By the Restoration of 1660 Puritanism and democracy in England gave place
               to Anglicanism and aristocracy.<note target="n1.2" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">2</hi>
               </note> Twenty-five years later when royal absolutism led James II to attack
               parliamentary traditions and the vested interests of church and state, the
               aristocracy took the lead in the movement against an unpopular king, thus identifying
               vested interests with the cause of British freedom.<note target="n1.3" anchored="yes"
                  TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">3</hi>
               </note> Quite naturally, therefore, an oligarchy of aristocrats replaced the
               discredited divine-right monarchy.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">In broad principles there was little difference between Whig and Tory at
               the beginning of the eighteenth century, for both were aristocratic and intent on the
               perpetuation of the existing social and economic order. However, since many Tories
               became suspect of Jacobitism, Whig ministers and a Whig majority in parliament seemed
               desirable and necessary to ardent Protestants, to supporters of the Hanoverian
               succession, and to the first Hanoverian Kings. The eighteenth century was, therefore,
               the period of a powerful Whig oligarchy, and even the efforts of the third Hanoverian
               King to revive personal rule made no essential difference. <q rend="in-line"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">It would be a conservative estimate to say that

               </note> The interests and desires of this class shaped the policies of English
               government from 1689 until the Industrial Revolution bore fruit in the nineteenth
               century, in the form of middle-class aspirations that would not be denied.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">The social aristocracy of the Hanoverian epoch included the titled
               nobles, the squires, higher clergy and the cultivated middle class, i.e., merchants
               and bankers, who shared business interests with the aristocracy or were related to
               them by blood or marriage alliance.<note target="n1.5" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               protection of life, liberty and property, and using it as justification of the
               Revolution of 1689, they believed that as property owners they were the indubitable
               custodians of a government designed to preserve the rights of property. The
               unprivileged might indeed be grateful to them for an England of tolerance toward
               Dissent, of comparative freedom of person, <pb n="2" id="p2" TEIform="pb"/> speech
               and press, an England whose parliamentary constitutionalism was the admiration of a
               continent still enslaved to priests and kings. The duty of the masses, aside from
               this gratitude and a due appreciation of the charitable deed, the kindly smile and
               condescending word of their betters&#8212;product of a mixture of benevolence, amusement
               and good-natured contempt&#8212;was to exhibit a proper contentment with the station in
               which God had placed them, and to refrain from meddling in what was none of their
               concern.</p>

               the English parliament of the eighteenth century was a ready instrument for this

            <p TEIform="p">When the settlement of 1689 ended the rivalry between Crown and
               Parliament, it made the latter the leading partner in a co-operation between the two

               </note> Increasingly, except during the interval of George III's personal rule, the
               Crown became a symbol and Parliament omnipotent. While supposed to represent the
               people of Great Britain, actually Parliament did so very imperfectly and unfairly.
               The Upper House, composed of titled landlords and Anglican ecclesiastics, was a
               purely aristocratic body. The House of Commons, as everyone knows, although more
               representative in appearance, was in reality scarcely less aristocratic. Neither
               Whigs nor Tories in the eighteenth century dreamed of reforming such a system. The
               enthusiasm for vested interests, engendered by the outrages which had provoked the
               Revolution of 1688, gave those interests a sacrosanct character and defied reform for
               one hundred and forty years. For this reason, and because Parliament had shrivelled
               up into the selfish organ of a small group, <q rend="in-line" direct="unspecified"
                  TEIform="q">the period of Walpole and the Pitts was the heyday of unchallenged
                  abuses in all forms of corporate life. Holders of ecclesiastical, academic,
                  charitable and scholastic endowments had no fear of enquiry or reform.
                  Schoolmasters could draw their salaries without keeping school. Universities could
                  sell degrees without holding examinations or giving instruction. Parliamentary
                  boroughs and municipal oligarchies could be as corrupt and ridiculous as they
                  liked; it was enough that they were old.</q>

               not surprising to find that in domestic policies the Oligarchy favored agriculture
               and the great landlords. Happily, economic self-interest could be garbed in patriotic
               dress. Tudor and Stuart <q rend="in-line" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q"
                  >enclosures</q> had been the means of improving agricultural production. With the
               growth of population the national food supply was becoming increasingly important. By
               capitalistic, large-scale scientific agriculture the yield (and profits) of English
               farming could be increased. Between 1700 and 1800 Parliament passed a series of
               Enclosure Acts giving noblemen and squires the privilege of depriving tenants of
               their former right to common holdings. Similarly, the continuation of the <pb n="3"
                  id="p3" TEIform="pb"/>Corn Laws long after Britain had ceased to be able to
               produce enough grain for her mounting population is evidence not only of the benefits
               reaped by the landed classes, but also of their ability to make their own interests
               appear as national needs. Continued into the nineteenth century Enclosures and Corn
               Laws were among the factors which sent droves of impoverished people to the British
               North American colonies, including New Brunswick, where they created heavy relief
               problems, and swelled that section of the population whose educational needs were
               most acute, but which exhibited the greatest indifference towards the benefits of
               education.</p>

               the navigation system was closely tied up with national existence. Although he
               opposed the Physiocratic idea that agriculture is the basis of wealth, and agreed
               that the natural laws by which a nation might increase its wealth were to be found in
               laissez-faire principles, he admitted that the defence of Great Britain depended much
               on the number of her sailors and her shipping, and that the Navigation Acts properly
               endeavored to give the seamen and ships of Great Britain the monopoly of the trade of
               their own country.<note target="n1.11" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               that the prosperity of a large number of British merchants and industrialists
               depended on schemes of trade protection. <q rend="in-line" direct="unspecified"

               whom the settlement of Anglo-American commerce largely devolved, when he enunciated
               the rule that 'It was better to have no colonies at all, than not to have them

            <p TEIform="p">In spite of certain compensations, British trade regulations sacrificed
               the interests of the American colonies to the interests of England or the Sugar
               Islands. They were tolerated, however, for many years, partly because they were not
               rigidly enforced, and partly because the weak and disunited Thirteen Colonies were
               dependent on British aid for security against France. When the outcome of the Seven
               Years' War had ended that danger, a revival of the Navigation Acts and a determined
               effort to enforce them contributed to the causes creating irreconcilable differences
               between England and the American Colonies.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">After the loss of these possessions the power of tradition and the
               propaganda of vested interests continued strong enough to maintain the mercantilist
               scheme, with some concessions and modifications, for several decades of the
               nineteenth century. It follows, therefore, that during New Brunswick's colonial
               tutelage, her trade relations with Great Britain, the United States, and the West
               Indies, hinged largely on the British trade and navigation system.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">The relationships between church and state also furnish many interesting

               the established church may connote loyalty. In general, national churches tend to

               secured even to Roman Catholics and Unitarians a considerable degree of free
               religious worship. Of religious equality, however, there was none until the
               nineteenth century, for the Church of England, while no longer a persecuting body,

            <p TEIform="p">In this field of educational endeavor one finds the chief significance of
               eighteenth-century Anglicanism for British North America. Through various missionary
               agencies, by means of political machinery, by alliances with <q rend="in-line"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">Family Compacts</q>, the Anglican Church
               exercised a monopoly over the educational institutions of those North American
               colonies still in British hands after the American Revolution. Moreover, the
               Loyalists, Americans though they were, looked to Great Britain for intellectual, as
               well as political, sponsorship. Consequently, theories and practices prevalent in the
               English educational system were naturally features of colonial educational schemes,
               modified though they might be by pioneer conditions and American influences. An

               attribute of aristocracy, a badge of superiority, a qualification for leadership.
               That the dominant classes were conscious of this implication is indicated by the

               the American colonies there was a shifting of emphasis from the old exclusively
               religious purpose toward a new view of education as preparation for life in the
               world, in Church of England schools the end and design continued to be instruction in
               the knowledge and practice of the Christian religion as taught in the Church of
                  England.<note target="n1.31" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               There was a suspicion that it would teach labourers to despise their lot, read bad
               books, and imbibe bad doctrine. Consequently, the Church stoutly maintained the
               attitude that <q rend="in-line" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">education must be
                  the handmaid of religion</q>, and through charity and parochial schools, Sunday

                  of the Poor</q>, exercised almost exclusive control of education for the lower
               classes. In all these schools Bible-reading and the Catechism formed the major part
               of the meagre curriculum.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">It was the special function of the eighteenth century to civilize manners

               </note> Besides finding in science a new standard of truth and in reason a new
               authority, the Enlightenment gave an impulse to an interest <pb n="7" id="p7"
                  TEIform="pb"/>in humanity, and, along with the Wesleyan Revival, helped to
               strengthen a conviction that the lot of mankind could, and should, be improved.
               Humanitarian movements, warmed by the blaze of romanticism and stirred to pity by the
               desperate plight of victims of waxing industrialization, multiplied in numbers and
               influence in the nineteenth century, and in the educational field compensated in some
               measure for the inertia of the public authorities. For the most part, however, the
               purpose of charity schools was to teach morals and religion. Illiteracy to the
               philanthropists was only one aspect of general moral delinquency, <q rend="in-line"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">and education was attached to the program of
                  social reform only as a means to the larger end of removing profligacy,
                  drunkenness and crime . . . The educational motive was not to provide opportunity
                  for the lower classes to raise themselves to superior social stations, but to make
                  them less of an eyesore in the face of respectability</q>, and, particularly after
               the French Revolution, to render them less susceptible to the blandishments of
               political and social radicals. The real purpose of philanthropic educational agencies
               was to Christianize: it was but incidental that they also helped to educate.<note

               </note> But whatever the motive, schools founded and maintained through the
               benevolence and initiative of individuals and societies did extend a knowledge of the
               elements of learning to the poorer classes of society throughout the eighteenth
               century, and on into the next.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">An understanding of the English conception of education as a private and

               country in the eighteenth century. Individualism expressed itself in a perfect welter
               of institutions. At the top were the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, wrapped in
               the traditions of the past, <q rend="in-line" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q"

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">34</hi>
               </note> Below the Universities was a chaos of secondary schools, many of them heavily
               endowed. The most important were the great boarding-schools known as Public Schools,
               such as Eton, Winchester, Charterhouse, Rugby, and Harrow. These great secondary
               schools had been established to educate leaders and to give free education to a fixed
               number of poor boys. But very early the word <q rend="in-line" direct="unspecified"
                  TEIform="q">poor</q> in the title deeds was interpreted to mean the sons of poor
               gentlemen, and various expedients were employed to evade the founders, liberal
               intentions. In time, the sons of the local butcher and baker felt out of place among
               the gentlemen's sons, and ceased to enrol. In many of the Grammar Schools, and
               especially in the larger Public Schools, the fees were so high that only boys from
               fairly well-to-do families could attend. By the end of the eighteenth century the
               larger Public Schools were attended by the sons of the nobility, country gentry,
               merchant princes, and professional classes, and the smaller more local Grammar
               Schools had the patronage of members of the <pb n="8" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/>middle
               commercial class and the poorer members of the landowning and professional
                  groups.<note target="n1.35" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </note> As fiercely as the boys defended their schoolboy mores, just as fiercely did
               the administrators resent any interference in management. Misapplication of revenues,
               extravagances, favoritism, patronage, maladministration, had, indeed, little to fear
               so long as Parliament was an aristocratic oligarchy and tradition a fetish.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">The instruction in these English secondary schools was in conformity with
               the traditional spirit of humanism. By the close of the seventeenth century the

               of Learning, had been introduced into the secondary schools and universities of
               Europe, had shrunk into the lesser aim of imparting a mastery of the Ciceronian style

               English language, literature, history, geography or civil government. The entire
               scholastic effort was expended on learning the Latin grammar, writing Latin prose or
               verse and translating Latin classics, or in similar exercises in Greek. Benthamites

               as a source of national greatness, was the aristocratic spirit with which they were
               imbued, and the manly training achieved through games and vigorous, if rough,

               represented the only form of education supported in the eighteenth century by

               the Tory press, as a public danger, as breeding-grounds of political and religious

               attracted attention in England, spread to the continent, and met with ready
               acceptance m the United States. This was based on the system of mutual or monitorial
               instruction, and seemed to be the answer to the demand for cheap education. Two
               organizations, the <q rend="in-line" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">National

               clergymen, were fairly well paid, and ranked well in social opinion, but elsewhere
               the abilities, virtues, and emoluments of the profession were small. Teachers in the

               the social realists, Locke and Montaigne, had condemned the school training of their

               than the memory, but the ideals of educational theorists were long neglected in
               actual practice. To teach was to tell: to learn was to memorize. The rod was a

               not infrequently boasted of the number of lashes, slaps, and blows which they had
               imparted during their teaching career. The natural interests, the capacities, and
               even the feelings of children were not studied or considered. Scarcely any books had

               must be tempered by the realization that it harmonized with prevailing attitudes and

               humiliations suffered at the hands of Napoleon necessitated a national regeneration.
               In England, the slower process of evolution took the place of revolution. If, in
               retrospect, that evolution in the educational field seems unconscionably deliberate,
               one must remember that it was part of a complex process and was conditioned by many
               factors.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">The significance of the connection between England's colonial possessions
               and the aristocratic tradition in English society, politics, business, and culture,
               only casually suggested in this chapter, will emerge more clearly later for in the
               development of New Brunswick this background often obtruded. But if ties of
               allegiance and dependence bound the province to Britain, other ties linked it with
               Britain's earlier colonies. The Loyalists were British, but they were also American.
               It is not enough to know something of conditions in the country to which they adhered
               politically and spiritually. The reasons for that adherence, the things they rejected
               as repugnant, and the cultural heritage which they brought with them to New Brunswick
               were to be found in America rather than in England. The American setting is therefore
               an integral part also of any study of New Brunswick history.</p>

            <head TEIform="head"> CHAPTER 2 <lb/>THE AMERICAN BACKGROUND</head>

            <p TEIform="p">The pattern of eighteenth-century English education harmonized with the
               social, economic, and political fabric of the time and place. Both the warp and woof
               of American education in the same period exhibited many of the same aristocratic and
               exclusive fibres, but woven into the piece were other threads, strong, if sometimes
               coarse, manufactured of environment, and dyed with the vivid color of the American
               spirit. To change the metaphor, American education in the eighteenth century
               reflected the struggle in American life between aristocratic and democratic
               tendencies. We shall try to account for these tendencies and to note their influence
               in the various departments of American life, with particular reference to education;
               to take cognizance of the social aspects of the American Revolution; and to see where
               the Loyalists stood in relation to aristocracy and democracy.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">Politically, all the American colonies in the seventeenth century, except
               during the upheaval of the English Civil War, centred in England and maintained with
               her close relations in every field of life.<note target="n2.1" anchored="yes"

                  have been left off the American social cake owing to the fact that none of the
                  titled members of the aristocracy came as permanent residents,</q>

               </note> the gentry and the merchants, those members of the middle orders next to the
               English aristocracy in the hierarchy of rank and wealth, became the colonial
               aristocracy and claimed deference and privilege. Even the founders of the
               Massachusetts Bay Colony had been <q rend="in-line" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q"
                  >fashioned by a caste society</q> and brought over <q rend="in-line"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">an abundant heritage of class prejudice . . .
                  They honored rank, were sticklers for precedent, respected class distinctions,
                  demanded the hereditary rights of the gentry.</q>

                  relations they recognized a caste as objectionable as that which they had been

               <q rend="in-line" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">Every colony had this class

               </note> with varying economic, political, religious, and social privileges forming
               the lines of demarcation. For example, in the seventeenth century in New England,
               even seating in church was regulated by an elaborate system based on social standing,
               and as late as the middle of the eighteenth century the names of students at Yale and
               Harvard were arranged according to the wealth and social prestige of their families.
               In the Middle Colonies, where agricultural possibilities were greater than in stony
               New Eng-<pb n="13" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/>land, the manorial lords of the Hudson
               valley created a landed aristocracy, and in the south, partiality to large estates
               worked by indentured servants and negro slaves stimulated the theory of social
               superiority and inferiority.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">Class distinctions were inevitably accompanied, as in Europe, by the idea
               of minority rule. When John Winthrop accounted democracy to be the meanest and worst
               government, and John Cotton declared he could not imagine that God had ordained it as
               a 'fitt government eyther for church or commonwealth',<note target="n2.6"

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">6 </hi>
               </note>they expressed the view of contemporary and subsequent leaders in church and
               state. By restricting the franchise, by denying equal representation to the back
               counties, by exerting influence and control through the colonial councils, the landed
               gentlemen and merchants of the tidewater area maintained minority rule against <q
                  rend="in-line" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">a numerous democracy</q>.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">One of the most interesting examples of oligarchic rule in America was
               the Massachusetts theocracy of the seventeenth century. Political and economic
               motives, as well as moral and religious, had prompted the emigration, but the
               leaders, John Winthrop, John Cotton and others, aimed at the creation of a
               self-governing Bible commonwealth, <q rend="in-line" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q"

               </note> Civil and religious authorities cooperated in protecting the new state
               against error from without and schism from within, but the clergy were <q

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">9</hi>
               </note> Gradually, however, the supremacy of the theocracy was undermined by a number
               of forces, and when the royal absolutism which Charles II and James II had attempted
               to substitute was itself demolished in 1689, theocratic rule was not fully restored
               in Massachusetts, and in the new charter of 1691 the basis of the franchise was no
               longer church membership, but property. However, taxpayers still had to contribute to
               the Established Congregational Church.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">In education, colonial ideas and practices were very similar to those
               already described in connection with English education; Provincial culture is
               inevitably derivative in its origins. <q rend="in-line" direct="unspecified"

               the poor. The children of the gentry were educated under private tutors or were sent
               to England. Thus those who proudly carried on the tradition of the Cavalier <q

            <p TEIform="p">Although certain provisions for education in Massachusetts were unique,
               motives and purposes were in harmony with tradition. In the Calvinistic conception of

            <p TEIform="p">In one feature of New England education, the <q rend="in-line"

               relationship to the parish schools established over a hundred years later in rural
               New Brunswick. After 1689, when the population began to expand toward the outer
               sections of the towns, children living on the outskirts found difficulty in attending
               the school at the village centre, especially in winter. If the school happened to be
               supported by taxation, families complained of paying taxes from which they received
               little or no benefit, and petitioned for a division of the town into districts. This
               was a democratic move, in a sense, but the small school unit often necessitated a
               very short school term, because of the inability of the small districts to raise
               adequate funds.<note target="n2.24" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </note> In some cases difficulty in agreeing on the location of a school resulted in

               </note> A somewhat similar procedure was authorized in New Brunswick in 1805 in
               connection with grammar schools, only the moving was done from one parish to another,
               until all the parishes of a county had had the benefit of the county grammar school.
               It is not unlikely that this expedient in New Brunswick was derived from the New
               England experience.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">The curriculum of colonial schools in the Pre-Revolutionary period was
               derivative in nature. In the colleges and secondary schools the narrow classical
               instruction of English educational institutions was carried out, and in the
               elementary schools the instruction was of the same limited nature as in England. The
               method of learning, as well as the curriculum, might be described as that of the
               three R's. <q rend="in-line" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">The pupils were

            <p TEIform="p">In the colonial scheme of education <q rend="in-line"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">girls met with the traditional
                  discriminations</q>. They were, of course, shut out from colleges and grammar
               schools, but were generally admitted to the elementary schools. Under private
               patronage schools were opened in some regions where girls of the middle classes might
               learn reading, writing, arithmetic, sewing, music, and dancing, but in general women
               were expected to stick to household matters.<note target="n2.27" anchored="yes"

            <p TEIform="p">While inheritance and tradition influenced colonial institutions and
               ideals, a variety of other influences weaned the American colonies from their Old
               World heritage and created an independence of spirit characteristically American and
               favorable to the growth of democracy.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">Among these influences were geographical conditions. <q rend="in-line"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">The separateness of Britain and her colonies was
                  based upon conditions beyond the power of man to change, upon the broad expanse of
                  the Atlantic, upon soil, climate and geography.</q> Slowly, but inevitably, these
               conditions changed the Englishmen of the colonies into Americans.<note target="n2.28"

            <p TEIform="p">Secondly, in spirit many of the original settlers were sympathetic toward
               the principles underlying the Puritan Revolution. In the little colony at Plymouth
               there were the germs of American democracy. Before leaving the Mayflower the male
               adults compacted to enact and observe laws for the general good.<note target="n2.30"

               </note>That a group of people should take upon themselves the responsibility for
               self-government was unprecedented. Rhode Island, founded as a simple democracy by
               Roger Williams <q rend="in-line" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">tolerated from the

               </note> The original charter of Massachusetts, in granting freemen the right to
               decide taxation and to choose officials, contained the seeds of democracy. An
               oligarchy may have been set up and democratic tendencies discouraged, yet democratic
               possibilities were never entirely absent, especially in the minds of enlightened men
               like John Wise, who declared early in the eighteenth century that all power was
               originally in the people, that the only end of government was to promote the good of
               all, and that it was as plain as daylight there was no species of government like a
               democracy to attain that end.<note target="n2.32" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

            <p TEIform="p">The New England democracy of labour, the township form of community, the
               town meeting, all fostered an independent spirit. So did the New England method of
               land holding. Land was granted in fee simple, that is, outright, without feudal dues
               or primogeniture and entail. In this independ <pb n="17" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/>ent
               ownership of land and in the development of many small farms can be seen a cause for
               the rise of a democratic society.<note target="n2.33" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">33</hi>
               </note> Moreover, partly as a result of the Civil War in England, the New England
               colonies, especially Massachusetts, were able to act almost as independent states.
               During the period of the Whig oligarchy, interest and effort in England were
               concentrated on the furtherance of landed and commercial interests in the mother
               country, and for a time all the colonies were more or less neglected. Thus the
               colonists grew accustomed to managing their own affairs, and aversion to outside
               control took deep root.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">Diversity of national origins was another factor in the development of an
               independent American spirit. Thousands of people entered the country without any
               previous allegiance to England, as in the case of French Huguenots and Germans, or
               with active hostility against her, as in the case of Irish and Scotch-Irish. These
               felt no love for the British government or for her colonial officials who might
               hamper them in their grim struggle to acquire property rights in the new land of
                  promise.<note target="n2.34" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

                  evolution of distinctly American types of schools, better adapted to American
                  needs, became increasingly evident in the Colonies as the eighteenth century

               </note> The lead which Massachusetts gave all North America in educational progress
               may be partly attributed to this tradition of public education. That the state
               ordered provision to be made for education but left the actual provision, whether by
               subscription or taxation, to the individual community, is a fact of some
               significance. Long afterwards, in New Brunswick, when public apathy was proving a
               great hindrance to educational advance, two governors of that province attributed
               progress in the neighboring American states to the fact that education was a local
               responsibility in those states. Sir William Colebrooke wrote in 1842: <q

                  states of laying out the wilderness land in townships and of imposing on the

                  with the settlers of providing for these essential objects which the practice in

            <p TEIform="p">The changing political, economic, and social conditions in the colonies
               during the eighteenth century were particularly reflected in secondary education. The
               grammar school of the traditional English type began to decline, and we note the
               evolution of the American Academy, possibly connected through the Non-Conformist
               schools established in England after the Act of Conformity in 1662 with the
               institution which Milton described in his <hi rend="italic" TEIform="hi">Tract on
                  Education.</hi> The idea of offering instruction in a wide variety of subjects
               proved more acceptable in America than in England, because of the growing demand in
               America for a type of education related to the economic life of the place and time.
                  While<pb n="20" id="p20" TEIform="pb"/> the ancient languages continued to be
               taught in Academies as the mark of culture and social standing, a new emphasis was

               shipping, lumbering, and mercantile operations.) Another significant feature of
               colonial academies besides their practical curriculum was the fact that they were
               usually open to girls as well as to boys&#8212;an innovation in secondary education

            <p TEIform="p">When one endeavors, however, to isolate the social aspects of the

               of various social classes. Democratic frontiersmen were allied with merchants and

               and all the so-called Tories were not aristocrats and wealthy officials. But when we
               note the effect of the Revolution on those traditionary institutions and practices
               which, through the years, had helped to prop up aristocracy and minority rule, we

               for office holding and for voting were lowered at once, thus seriously undermining
               the old social system. The abolition of quit rents and the sweeping away of royal
               limitations on the acquisition and use of vacant lands transformed the land system.
               Tory estates, some of which embraced hundreds of square miles, were confiscated,
               broken into small lots, and distributed to farmers on easy terms. The system of
               entails and primogeniture was abolished in every state within fifteen years. This
               destruction of landed privilege was accompanied by an attack on ecclesiastical
               establishments. Within a few years the special privileges enjoyed by the established
               churches in the nine colonies which had featured tax-supported religion were
               relinquished. At the very time when the British government was increasing the
               severities of its penal code, in America a campaign was being waged, with eventual
               success, against barbarities in the criminal code. It is true that populism still had

               </note> When the British representatives at the peace negotiations failed to obtain
               terms safeguarding the Loyalists against the discriminations and persecutions to
               which many of them had been subjected there was no course for them but that of
               emigration.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">To join social and economic forces with the political and sentimental in
               accounting for the exodus of the Loyalists may seem to cast doubt upon their loyalty.
               To suggest that they were reactionaries may seem to disparage that loyalty. However,
               if analysis reveals other motives besides simple loyalty on the part of the
               Loyalists, and other characteristics besides those admirable ones for which they have
               been honored, one cannot disregard the facts, even at the risk of offending
               traditional sensibilities. That many of the Loyalists were <pb n="23" id="p23"
                  TEIform="pb"/> able and cultured is indicated by the fact that among those who
               came to Nova Scotia (including New Brunswick) were two hundred graduates of Harvard,
               and many from younger institutions.<note target="n2.65" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </note> That they possessed courage, endurance, and energy is revealed by their
               achievements and by their correspondence. The point we must note, however, is this:
               under the circumstances the choice which the Loyalists made meant that they embraced
                  <q rend="in-line" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">the ideal of a static
                  society.</q>

            <p TEIform="p">It has been said that the Maritime Provinces reaped the benefits and paid

            <p TEIform="p">Of Jonathan Odell, the first secretary of the Province of New Brunswick,
               it has been said: <q rend="in-line" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">When we examine
                  the work of Odell to discover the deeper springs of his thought, we come upon
                  naked class prejudice, undiluted Toryism</q>.<note target="n2.72" anchored="yes"

               </note> These are severe words, perhaps too severe, but one cannot deny that the
               leading Loyalists of New Brunswick brought with them notions of class distinctions
               and class privileges. That some of them contemplated the perpetuation of a privileged
               society based on huge estates is shown by the memorial signed by fifty-five prominent
               Loyalists in New York before the exodus, asking Sir Guy Carleton for grants along the
               Saint John River of five thousand acres each. Elias Hardy, who antedated Glenie as a
               champion of the people, was active against this application, which was not complied
               with, but <pb n="24" id="p24" TEIform="pb"/>Hardy's controversies, during the first
               year of settlement, with the Board of Directors in charge of the distribution of land
               would indicate that an effort was made by a number of Loyalists to obtain lots in
               excess of their deserts.<note target="n2.73" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">73</hi>
               </note> That they resented Hardy's interference is clear from bitter remarks made
               about <q rend="in-line" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">the illiberal insinuations
                  of that man Hardy</q>.<note target="n2.74" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </note>
            </p>


            <p TEIform="p">Further evidences of class prejudice on the part of the leading Loyalists
               may be seen in the political manoeuvres which figured in the contest between the
               Upper Cove and the Lower Cove during Saint John's first election and in the
               derogatory nature of sundry remarks concerning the Acadians and pre-Loyalist
               settlers. Closely allied with these feelings of political and social superiority was
               the premium placed on connection with the Anglican communion. For many years the
               Church of England enjoyed pre-eminence and assumed special privileges,<note
                  target="n2.75" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">75</hi>
               </note> although only a minority of the people of the province belonged to that
               church.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">The same narrow and exclusive spirit predominated in education. Men of
               education and culture, such as the leading Loyalists were, could not fail to
               recognize the importance of education, but their chief concern was for institutions
               in which gentlemen's sons should be educated. That they should think first of their
               own children was only natural; that progress in providing for educational facilities
               should be slow might be expected, considering the many pressing problems incidental
               to the founding of a province. The fact remains, however, that education in New
               Brunswick began with the old inherited ideas that education was a voluntary affair,
               that the first provision must be for secondary education along classical lines for
               the benefit of boys in the upper stratum of society, that the supervision of
               education was the prerogative of the clergy, and that the masses must go untutored or
               look to the efforts of religious, charitable and philanthropic agencies, such as <q
                  rend="in-line" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">The Society for the Propagation of
                  the Gospel</q>. We have seen that these views were current in England at the time
               and also in the American colonies to quite an extent. Lacking the impetus toward
               democratic education which the American Revolution furnished in the United States,
               founded by men one of whose reasons for being where they were was the perpetuation of
               their own society, hampered by the apathy of the bulk of the population, New
               Brunswick, as we shall see, moved forward but slowly from these eighteenth-century
               conceptions of education.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">Considering the circumstances under which the Loyalists left the Thirteen
               Colonies it is not surprising that they-launched the new province on a note of
               conservatism, nor is it strange that they brought with them a decided aversion to
               anything American. <q rend="in-line" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">A proper hatred
                  of the United States and an equally proper love of England became social decencies
                  to be expressed in tra <pb n="25" id="p25" TEIform="pb"/>ditional terms.</q>
               <note target="n2.76" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">76</hi>
               </note> This is quite understandable but also regrettable, for the intensity of the
               feeling directed against the United States and the lack of discrimination which
               characterized it were hindrances to progress, especially when educational
               developments in the United States during the nineteenth century might have proved a
               source of inspiration to New Brunswick. As late as 1839 Governor Harvey reported that
                  <q rend="in-line" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">the tide of prejudice . . .
                  still runs very strong in this Province against anything American</q>.<note

            </p>


            <p TEIform="p">The development of any colony cannot be explained wholly in terms of the
               character of its principal contingent of settlers. The location of the country, its
               natural resources, its natives, its neighbours, and its past history are all factors
               of importance. In order to appreciate the development of New Brunswick it is
               necessary to know something of the state of the country when the Loyalists came, and
               why it was what it was. Were the Loyalists likely to have a clear field for their
               energies, ideas and institutions? With what difficulties would the new environment
               confront them? Particularly, what economic forces arising out of the physical
               environment were bound to be at work in Loyalist society, for <q rend="in-line"

            <p TEIform="p">Nearly two hundred years after De Monts and Champlain caught their
               initial glimpse of the splendid harbour at the mouth of the Saint John river, first
               comers among the Loyalists, scanning the same shores with interest and anxiety,
               beheld a scene almost as wild and uncultivated as that which had greeted the eyes of
               Champlain. Bushes and cedar trees still covered the rocks and swamps which surrounded
               the harbour of the Saint John,<note target="n3.1" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               that description at the time of the arrival of the Loyalists that one of the exiles
               in the van of the migration could say that nothing but wilderness met the eye.<note

                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">uninhabited</q> to the New Brunswick of 1783 only
               in a figurative sense, for besides Acadians and Indians there were several
               settlements of English speaking people. Official and complete statistics for these
               pre-Loyalist settlements are not available for a later date than 1767,<note

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">5</hi>
               </note> which may be evidence of the scant attention paid to the area by the
               government at Halifax. Estimates of the number of Acadians and English speaking
               settlers in New Brunswick in 1783 can be found in various studies on Acadian history
               but from our standpoint there is little gain in attempting to track down the number
               of pre-Loyalist settlers to the last man. The significant thing is that in an area of
               nearly 28,000 square miles there were no more than 5,000 inhabitants exclusive of the
               natives. Thus the Loyalists, being more than double the old inhabitants in number,
               might well feel possessive about Nova Scotia-north-of-the-bay, and when it became a
               separate province in 1784 might think of it, with reason, as <q rend="in-line"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">par excellence the province of the Loyalists,</q>

            </p>


            <p TEIform="p">Only five thousand people! Yet New Brunswick, to use the present name,
               had been discovered nearly as early as any part of America, nor did it lack fish and
               furs, both great attractions in the early years of North American his tory.
               Geographically, too, it was nearer to Europe than Quebec or any of the thirteen
               colonies. Moreover, being separated from the St. Lawrence by the Appalachian
               Highland, as was New England, it formed an extension of the latter area and invited
               New England enterprise. But the energies of both French <pb n="27" id="p27"
                  TEIform="pb"/> and English were directed to more strategic or more productive
               areas, and settlement in Acadia, both north and south of the Bay of Fundy, developed
               in a haphazard fashion without much assistance or attention from Europe. Then too,
               the fur trade, although inviting, was not of the grand proportions of the St.
               Lawrence trade. Acadia, unlike Canada, was sprawling and irregular, lacking the great
               centralizing system of the highway of Canada. Since the St. Lawrence, rather than the
               Saint John, led to the great fur-bearing area of the interior, and since monopoly
               could not be successfully enforced in <q rend="in-line" direct="unspecified"
                  TEIform="q">this maritime world of obstreperous individualism and keen

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">7</hi>
               </note> organized trade in furs moved to the St. Lawrence, and the Acadian fur trade
               was left to a few adventurers whose individual operations were comparatively modest.
               Moreover, trade in furs did not necessarily imply colonization. In fact, the very
               nature of the business tended to discourage a settled existence, as Colbert
               discovered when pushing plans for the expansion of Louis XIV's empire on the St.
                  Lawrence.<note target="n3.8" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">8</hi>
               </note> The same was true of the fisheries. In the promotion of permanent settlement
               the fishing industry was little more effective than the fur trade, and New Brunswick,
               being less strategically situated than the peninsular part of Acadia in relation to
               the great bank fisheries, failed to acquire fishing stations comparable to Canso and
               Louisburg. Thus, for nearly two hundred years after its discovery, Acadia,
               particularly the mainland portion which is now New Brunswick, had few inhabitants
               save the native Indians. People did not come, or, when they did, seldom remained to
               establish permanent homes or to make a lasting impression on the country.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">Generally speaking, to official France and England Acadia seemed
               unimportant in itself, but in time of war it assumed importance because of its
               relation to French and English interests elsewhere. For external reasons, therefore,
               the country frequently changed hands but in times of peace both France and England
               tended to neglect it. One significant feature of the transfer of Acadia to English
               hands in 1654 lies in the fact that the conquest was effected by Bostonians, who,
               having been balked in their designs on the Dutch at Manhattan by the termination of
               the Dutch War, had decided that to spend 'a lytle tyme upon ye coast in lookeinge
               after ye ffrench might torne to some accompt'.<note target="n3.9" anchored="yes"

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">9</hi>
               </note> This decision was prophetic of a major interest which New England was to
               develop, an interest fraught with disastrous consequences for the Acadians.<note
                  target="n3.10" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">10</hi>
               </note> The other significant feature of this English interlude may be seen in the
               fact that it did not affect Nicholas Denys, French trader on the north shore of
               Acadia. In other words, French power continued in Acadia, and <q rend="in-line"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">this survival served as a reminder of the fact
                  that Acadia was a divided country which it was difficult to rule, and also
                  difficult to capture in its entirety.</q>
               <note target="n3.11" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

            </p>


            <p TEIform="p">After Acadia was restored to France in 1670 French efforts were
               concentrated on the building of a mighty empire at Quebec, and Acadia exper <pb
                  n="28" id="p28" TEIform="pb"/>ienced forty years of neglect. Only a few settlers
               were sent to the area, and fewer still found their way north of the Bay of Fundy. The
               true agricultural centre of Acadia was south and east of the Bay, where a small
               number of new settlers, and the descendants of de Razilly's colonizing venture of
               1632 spread remarkably along Minas Basin and Cobequid, and around Chignecto to
               Shepody. This was the Acadia of a peaceful peasantry. The other Acadia, between the
               Saint John and the frontier settlements of New England, was the scene of
               international conflict in which the Indians, incited by Quebec, played a terrible
                  part.<note target="n3.12" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">12</hi>
               </note>
               <q rend="in-line" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">It was the country's misfortune to
                  be the eastern outpost and flank for both France and England in America.</q> It
               became a fixed pivot on which an international battlefront seesawed back and forth
               between the French and the English.<note target="n3.13" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">13</hi>
               </note> Thus strong forces from without converged upon this sparsely peopled area,
               conflicted, and created a ferment which made life uneasy for those who were in the
               country, and discouraged others from coming. Raids, alarms and massacres were
               features of King William's War (1689-1697) and of Queen Anne's War (1701-1713). The
               capture of Port Royal in 1710 was motivated less by the fact that France and England
               were at war elsewhere than by the determination of Massachusetts to scotch the Indian
               snake in his lair west of the Saint John, to insure for New England freedom from
               raids, and to remove obstacles to the lucrative fisheries of Acadia and of
               Newfoundland beyond. The Treaty of Utrecht gave Acadia to England with all its
               ancient boundaries. <q rend="in-line" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">There were,
                  however, elements of future trouble in the refusal of the Acadians to take the
                  oath of allegiance to the English monarch, and in the claim which was first put
                  forward by Vaudreuil, the Governor of Canada, in 1718 that Acadia only comprised
                  the peninsula and did not include the territory now embraced in New Brunswick.</q>

            <p TEIform="p">The coming of peace lessened the strategic importance of Nova Scotia, as
               Acadia was now called, and for another period of forty years the country was more or

               an unfinished business, neither English nor New Englanders were tempted to choose as

               managed to ignore suggestions, invitations, and orders to take an unqualified oath of

            <p TEIform="p">When the great duel between France and England in North America came to a
               climax in the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years, War the

                  id="p29" TEIform="pb"/>linger over romantic names and dramatic episodes, we shall
               merely note that the course of the war brought misery and hardship to hundreds of
               inoffensive French peasants who were pawns in the international game, and that the
               outcome of the conflict closed the French regime.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">This period furnished but scanty materials for those interested in the
               history of Education. Primitive pioneer society, of necessity, can be concerned but
               little with things cultural. Habitant life, as A. R. M. Lower has pointed out, has
               never been characterized by desire for change, improvement, and progress.<note

               bore meagre scholastic fruit, although they were instrumental in spreading the tenets

            <p TEIform="p">There was little English settlement previous to 1760 although the
               founding of Halifax by Cornwallis in 1749 inaugurated a new British policy. His
               plans, and those of Governor Shirley of Massachusetts, called for the establishment
               of English settlements here and there in order to combat French pretensions, to drive
               wedges among the Acadians, and to make Nova Scotia really British.<note

               </note> This, however, proved difficult to carry out, not only because of the
               stubborn stand of the Acadians, but also because English-speaking Americans found
               little attraction in a country which lacked representative institutions, a country
               whose ultimate fate awaited the outcome of the issue between France and England.
               Those who came were chiefly merchants interested in the possibilities of money-making
               at Halifax. For five years after the founding of that city Nova Scotia remained <q

               rule in North America, New Englanders began to find their way to Nova Scotia, seeking
               the lands which privileged proprietorship denied them in New England. This
               immigration was part of the northward expansion of New England, a movement encouraged
               by the imperial authorities. It was <pb n="30" id="p30" TEIform="pb"/> accelerated by
               the necessity of providing for disbanded soldiers at the close of the Seven Years,

            <p TEIform="p">Among the townships which were established about this time the most
               remote from Halifax were three in the present New Brunswick, Sackville, Cumberland
               and Sunbury. Sackville was first settled in 1761 by families from Rhode Island and
               Massachusetts, and the Cumberland area east of Sackville received its first settlers
               about the same time. Sunbury was the huge district west of Sackville and Cumberland
               and east of the Saint John, extending from the Bay of Fundy to the southern boundary
               of Canada. Its principal settlements were at Maugerville and at the mouth of the
               Saint John river. In 1763 a group of settlers from Massachusetts, mostly ex-soldiers,
               under the leadership of Israel Perley had established themselves at Maugerville well
               up the river on its east bank.<note target="n3.24" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

            <p TEIform="p">For some years after 1764 a wave of land-grabbing and speculation
               flourished in Nova Scotia, often with government connivance. Favored individuals,

               Miramichi, and Beamsley Glasier's timber business on the Nashwaak. One point of
               significance may be noted in connection with land schemes along the Saint John river,
               namely, the careful and later exceedingly useful survey work which accompanied the
               laying out of the townships of Conway, Gage, Burton, Sunbury, and Newtown.<note

            <p TEIform="p">After 1768 there was a lull in American immigration resulting from the
               opening up of the Ohio Valley, and also a slackening of British immigration due to
               the opposition of British landlords. The Passamaquoddy area, however, received about
               thirty families in 1770 and in 1772 a group of Yorkshiremen came to the Sackville
                  township.<note target="n3.31" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </note> These and the other establishments in New Brunswick, remote from the
               wrangling of Council, Assembly and Governor at Halifax, developed quietly in their
               own way without much interference or even attention from the capital. Records of
               these settlements are tantalizingly meagre. From the fact that the settled lands were
               good, especially those in the Saint John valley, we may suppose that farming
               operations were a success. <q rend="in-line" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">The
                  stoneless alluvial lands, the rich natural pastures, and the parklike magnificent
                  forests, free of underbrush, made the valley a prize for the pioneer farmer even
                  when he had not the capital to trade largely in its furs or to build a

               exported $ 100,000 worth of furs, staves, fish, and lime in the period from 1764 to

            <p TEIform="p">The Pre-Loyalist inhabitants of New Brunswick belonged for the most part
               to the Congregational Church, a circumstance which did not enhance their social and
               political importance in the eyes of leading Loyalists when the latter arrived.
               According to Hannay, the settlers on the Saint John river found in religion, and also
               in rum, solace and excitement for lives of isolation and hard work.<note

               This New England institution had been promised by implication when Governor Lawrence,

               infrequently held illegal gatherings in the years immediately preceding the
               Revolution. It is hardly likely that the Maugerville meeting of May, 1776, which
               approved of union with the American cause,<note target="n3.38" anchored="yes">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">38</hi>

            <p TEIform="p">As one would expect, public provision for education during this period
               was slight. The imperial authorities probably felt that they had done all that <pb

               S. P. G. and directed that four hundred acres of land in each township should be

               </note> In reality this generous-sounding provision could be only a gesture until the
               lands became productive of revenue. Legislation relating to schools before 1783 seems
               to have been confined to <q rend="in-line" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">An Act
                  concerning Schools and Schoolmasters</q> in 1766. In harmony with the idea of the
               importance of clerical supervision the licensing of teachers was to be subject to the
               approval of the clergy. If there were no settled minister, the examination of the
               candidate was to be held by two Justices of the Peace for the county, provided that
               at least six inhabitants of the area could certify to the good character of the

               begin until after the Loyalist arrival. Such schools as there were in this part of
               Nova Scotia before 1783 were conducted intermittently by teachers of the itinerant
               type, were generally held in private houses, and offered a very rudimentary
               education. Books were scarce, and the masters, paid by the subscription method and
               often in produce, received a mere pittance.<note target="n3.44" anchored="yes"

               </note>Obviously, one of the great problems to confront the Loyalists on their
               arrival was the lack of opportunity for the education of their children, but the
               absence of any definite school system did leave them free within the framework of
               their economic circumstances to build on the old basis of class and church.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">Except for a few observations we may dismiss the story of Nova Scotia
               during the Revolution as having but slight bearing on our theme. For a number of
               reasons the people of the province in general either adhered to the British cause or
               failed effectively to support the rebels, even the majority of New Englanders finding
               charms in the neutrality for which they had roundly abused the Acadians a few decades
               before. The present New Brunswick was the scene of the only real invasion directed
               against Nova Scotia during the conflict, minor enterprise though it was, and the
               country did not entirely escape those features of the struggle which made life
               miserable for the Fundy folk and the fishermen of the south coast. The people of
               Maugerville, whether because of their New England affiliations, grievances against
               the distant government at Halifax, or fear of attack by the Malicete Indians, sent to
               Massachusetts protestations of attachment, listened to Eddy when he sought aid for
               his Cumberland venture, <pb n="33" id="p33" TEIform="pb"/>and even endorsed the
               scheme by joining his expedition in small numbers. The settlements at Sackville and
               Cumberland had the choice between loyalty and rebellion closely presented to them
               when Jonathan Eddy arrived in their midst with his daring plan of attack on Fort
               Cumberland. But Eddy's attack turned into a fiasco and John Allan, Seth Noble,
               Phineas Nevers, and others who had been most <q rend="in-line" direct="unspecified"
                  TEIform="q">hearty</q> in the rebel cause fled to Maine. When a series of
               circumstances and events had relieved Nova Scotia from the fear of an American
               invasion, the Revolution, as far as the fourteenth colony was concerned, was over
               except for the aftermath of Loyalist immigration. The Loyalists, not unnaturally,
               considered the loyalty of the people of the province to be of a much paler shade than
               their own, a belief which tended to make them regard the <q rend="in-line"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">old inhabitants</q> as a poor lot.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">From this brief review of the early history of Nova Scotia, one is
               impressed by the insularity of the colony and by its separateness from the rest of
               North America, a separateness which was intensified by the break with the Thirteen
               Colonies in the Revolution. This isolation should have given it a national unity, but
               geographical diversities, the scattered nature of the settlements, and differences in
               outlook between the government and the New Englanders who peopled the country worked
               against unity. Although the majority of the population were Americans, business and
               government tied the country to England, and the province, like Quebec, kept its
               independence of the United States and refused to become part of a great continental
               economy.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">We have observed that that part of Nova Scotia which became New Brunswick
               was so negligibly settled previous to the coming of the Loyalists as to be almost
               empty. The Loyalists, therefore, could be sure of land enough for homes, and of a
               clear field for whatever institutions they might wish to establish. It is doubtful if
               they all realized before their arrival how difficult life in this wilderness was to
               be. From those who were cultured and town-bred pioneer life was to demand a heavy
               price, taking toll of their energies, cramping their ambitions, blighting their
               literature, and modifying their incipient institutions. Those early years were to
               constitute a testing time&#8212;and <q rend="in-line" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q"

            <p TEIform="p">This brief excursion into Nova Scotian history has shown us that
               economically and geographically Nova Scotia was part of New England, in spite of ties

               the best natural market of the Maritime Provinces would henceforth be, for political

               province north and west of the Bay of Fundy- there was bound to be such a lack of
               necessities that the inhabitants would have to turn to the nearest source of supply,
               the United States. In other words, the new province was likely to find itself pulled
               two ways, as had happened to Nova Scotia twice before, with adverse effects on its
               economy.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">In 1783, however, the Loyalists turned away physically and emotionally
               from the old colonies. To their leading men the new land presented a challenge,
               despite personal deprivations, and with wonderful courage and optimism they accepted
               that challenge. <q rend="in-line" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">By Heaven we will

            <head TEIform="head">CHAPTER 4<lb/>THE LOYALIST PATTERN</head>


            <p TEIform="p">It is customary to think of the first fifty years of New Brunswick
               history as a period of remarkable achievement in the face of terrific obstacles. No
               one can gainsay the difficulties or deny that much solid ground-work was laid, but in
               the realm of ideas the foundation years were marked in large degree by traditional
               thinking, conservatism, and even reaction. These traits, as we have already observed,
               were inherent in the colonial mentality of the American Tories, and they were
               strengthened during and after the Revolution by the proud association with loyalty.
               Those who have had to flee in order to save cherished traditions from the irreverent
               hands of iconoclasts are apt to think forever after in terms of those traditions&#8212;
               in fact tradition itself becomes a fetish, and desire for change is damned as
               blasphemy and treason.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">In our treatment of the British background we noted that the Whigs of the
               eighteenth century were influenced by tradition in their thinking, and tended to
               follow comfortable routine in practice. These tendencies, however, were even more
               marked among the Tories, so that the term Toryism became identified with the
               maintenance of the old order, while the Whigs of the nineteenth century became the
               apostles of change. The excesses of the French Revolution tended to confirm Toryism
               everywhere and to discredit popular movements, even blighting the hopes of many
               English poets and idealists. Nothing good, it seemed, could come out of France. In
               education, for instance, even if England's leaders had been disposed to pay heed to
               the theories of liberal-minded men in other countries, the shadow of the Revolution
               was black enough to obscure Mirabeau's proposals for the establishment of primary
               schools throughout France, and a teachers' college as part of a National Lycée at
               Paris. Talleyrand's Report (1791) proposing the organization of a complete state
               system of public instruction for France, and Condorcet's bill (1792) embodying a
               democratic theory of education,<note target="n4.1" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">1</hi>
               </note> being part of a French revolutionary programme, could not merit the
               enthusiasm of thorough Britishers. During the Napoleonic struggle, and the
               reactionary years heralded by the Congress of Vienna, the progress in educational
               organization and in the application to practice of new theories of education which
               was achieved by Prussia, England's ally against Napoleon, caused no flurry in English
               educational circles. Prussia, decades ahead of the rest of Europe in educational
               reform, achieved early in the nineteenth century a state-supported system of
               secondary schools, and of Volksschules or People's Schools, a central Department of
               Public Instruction, a university aiming to produce scholars capable of advancing
               knowledge by personal research, and the elevation of teaching to a profession through
               the establishment of sem- <pb n="36" id="p36" TEIform="pb"/> inaries where teachers
               were carefully trained, not only in knowledge, but also in the art of teaching. In
               these seminaries Pestalozzian principles<note target="n4.2" anchored="yes"
                  TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">2</hi>
               </note> were at work, for one of the first steps taken by the new department of
               education was to send seventeen Prussian teachers to Switzerland for three years at
               the government's expense, to study the ideas of Pestalozzi, and to warm themselves <q
                  rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">at the sacred fire which burns in
                  the heart of this man, so full of strength and love</q>. In 1809 Zeller, one of
               Pestalozzi's pupils, was called to set up a Seminary in Prussia to train teachers in
               Pestalozzi's methods, and the seventeen Prussian teachers, on their return from
               Switzerland, were also made directors of training establishments. The spirit of these
               men, thus warmed by the new conception of education, was expressed by Dinter,
               Superintendent of Education in East Prussia, when he said: <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">I promised God, that I would look upon every
                  Prussian peasant child as a being who could complain of me before God, if I did
                  not provide him with the best education, as a man and a Christian, which it was
                  possible for me to provide</q>.<note target="n4.3" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">3</hi>
               </note> Official purposes, however, back of these educational reforms were more
               nationalistic than democratic,<note target="n4.4" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">4</hi>
               </note> but if England failed to be influenced by Prussia's example it was not
               because she was far-sighted enough to see that schools dominated by nationalistic
               motives might become mere nurseries of fanatical patriotism, but rather because what
               happened in Prussia seemed to have no significance for England. Obviously, after Jena
               and Tilsit, Prussia needed a thorough regeneration. The Prussian king had said that
               the state must regain in mental force what it had lost in territory and
                  splendor.<note target="n4.5" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">5</hi>
               </note> But just as obviously, to die-hard Tories, England needed no such
               regeneration, therefore no such drastic changes as Prussia was making were necessary.
               Besides, as we have noted earlier, the English, as a nation, tended to ignore or heed
               little what other nations were doing. Practically nothing, therefore, was done
               towards a solution of the problem of popular education&#8212;if indeed the question was
               recognized as a problem. In 1807 Whitbread, with his Parochial Schools' Act, raised
               for the first time in the British Parliament the question of the propriety of
               diffusing education among the poorer classes, pointing out that if the schools did
               not educate, the gutter would, but the bill was rejected by the Lords who feared that
               education would make the poor dissatisfied and indolent.<note target="n4.6"
                  anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">6</hi>
               </note> The main champion of a national system of education after the death in 1815
               of Whitbread was Henry Brougham, whose addresses, committees of enquiry, and bills
               did awaken interest.<note target="n4.7" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">7</hi>
               </note> But Toryism was still in the saddle; and the English parliament was yet
               unreformed, in spite of the growing demands of the rising industrial capitalist class
               that they be added to the list of those who ruled England. Educational reforms,
               therefore, as well <pb n="37" id="p37" TEIform="pb"/> as political, social, and
               economic, had to wait for the first cautious steps of the Whigs after the Bill of
               1832. Clearly, no progressive inspiration in educational matters could come from
               across the water to New Brunswick in the early years of that province.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">In line with the mother country's traditional conservatism were her
               colonial policies of the period. In spite of the American Revolution these differed
               but little from those which had helped to alienate the thirteen colonies. Many of the
               officials who sought for some lesson to be learned from that tragedy concluded that
               too much, not too little, democracy had wrecked the first British Empire, and that it
               was therefore advisable to strengthen the principle of authority. Almost all the
               serious questions which faced Britain as she contemplated the remnants of her
               imperial dominions were answered in the traditional fashion.<note target="n4.8"

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">8</hi>
               </note> The very establishment of New Brunswick as a separate province was part of a
               British plan to divide and rule. There were, of course, local factors involved<note

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">9</hi>
               </note>&#8212;the distance of the region from the seat of government at Halifax; the
               homogeneity of the population; the dissatisfaction of the Saint John Loyalists with
               the administration, especially in the matter of land grants; their desire to assume
               the role of office-holders; and the wish of Governor Parr to be rid of responsibility
               for the settlers north of the Bay of Fundy, whom he termed <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">of a turbulent disposition</q>

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">10</hi>
               </note>&#8212;but the division was too prompt and complete to be the result of these
               alone, as Lord Durham admitted long afterwards.<note target="n4.11" anchored="yes"
                  TEIform="note">

            <p TEIform="p">It is interesting to compare the spirit in which the province of New
               Brunswick was established with that which pulsed and throbbed at the inception of the
               American republic in spite of sectional contradictions. To the New Brunswick of 1784
               one can apply almost the direct negative of a number of those statements<note

               </note> which a vision of the young Republic has drawn from a noted historian. For

               formed. Between the Loyalists and the independent Americans yawned a great gulf made
               by the Revolution. Soon the French Revolution would stamp as detestably Jacobin,
               French theories of equality and doctrines of perfectability and progress. Thus the

               and legislative functions in one body until 1833, met behind closed doors until 1834,
               and, until 1817, was composed entirely of Anglicans. The first Council was drawn from
               the Loyalist elite, although the pre-Loyalist class was not without its

               dominance of a few ruling families and to deserve indeed the name of Family Compact.

               Office. This loyal purpose meant, in effect, that the Council should enjoy
               exclusively the dignities, emoluments, and prerogatives of office-holding. Such a
               group, composed as it was of lawyers, judges, and administrators, could know little
               of the problems of the commercial classes or of the rural inhabitants,<note

               for which the Council, as His Excellency's advisers, shared responsibility with the
               Governor and Colonial Office.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">Fifty years and more after the founding of the province, the wisdom of
               admitting the commercial classes to the Council was still a debatable question in
               certain quarters. In 1824, Sir Howard Douglas, a more liberal-minded governor than
               many of the incumbents of the office, wrote that he intended to look around for a
               gentleman actually in mercantile business in Saint John who might have the
               qualifications, influence, and information respecting the commercial affairs of the
               Province. By this appointment, wrote Douglas, <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified"
                  TEIform="q">higher consideration might be shown to the commercial interests, which
                  are not at present in a sufficient degree of influence in the Council Board</q>.
               On the margin of this letter we find written: <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified"
                  TEIform="q">The answer states, no precedent for such a procedure.</q>

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">23</hi>
               </note> Later, toward the close of the period here being considered, the then
               governor, Sir Archibald Campbell, writing on the subject of appointments to the
               Executive Council, admitted uneasiness over the growing tendency in the House of
               Assembly to acquire such an ascendency in the Administration as would, if successful,
               destroy the proper balance between the Executive and Legislative branches. The
               composition, therefore, of His Majesty's Council was highly important. It must be so
               constituted as to interpose efficiently, but tactfully enough to avoid collision with
               the lower House, between the People's representatives and the Authorities of the
               Crown. Qualified men, in the opinion of the Governor, were scarce. Vacancies must
               necessarily be filled up from the lawyer and merchant classes. It was only fair that
               a proportion of the latter class should be selected, but one must, the Governor
               thought, <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">be very careful not to
                  give them too much weight or influence at the Council Board.</q>

               </note> In view of this attitude it is not surprising to find that not a little
               opposition to the oligarchic Council came from the commercial interests of Saint
               John, a city resentful, to begin with, of the choice of Fredericton as capital, and
               incensed by the stubborn refusal of the Governor and Council to have certain sessions
               of the Supreme Court held in Saint John.<note target="n4.25" anchored="yes"

            <p TEIform="p">To Carleton and the Home Authorities, an Assembly seemed of dubious
               value, but the Loyalists, as British, considered a representative body to be one of
               the inalienable rights of Englishmen, and, as American colonials, they were
               thoroughly familiar with its workings. An Assembly, therefore, was unavoidable, but
               Carleton postponed calling one as long as possible. The first Assembly, which met on
               January 3, 1786, was constituted on the basis of a liberal franchise, all males
               twenty-one years and over, resident in the province for three months, having the
               right to vote, except, of course, the Indians and French, the latter being
               disqualified because of their religion. This franchise, and even the more restricted
               one which soon superseded the first, were, by comparison with the regulations in
               England, exceedingly liberal, and indicate a con- <pb n="40" id="p40" TEIform="pb"/>

               </note> The Assembly, however, often had hard going to make its weight felt against a
               Governor responsible only to the Home Authorities, and a Council responsible only to
               the Governor. Moreover, in the early years of the province lack of effective
               communication often prevented members from attending the sessions<note target="n4.27"

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">27</hi>
               </note> and the opposition of the Council to the payment of members for their
               services precluded the attendance of those lacking personal means.<note

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">28</hi>
               </note> The rank and file of the people, who seldom saw a newspaper and who were
               intensely occupied with the business of making a home, could not always understand
               the issues at stake, or find significance in them, and thus men were sometimes
               elected, as still not infrequently happens, who were more concerned with serving
               their own interests than with promoting the welfare of the province. Thus the
               Council, aided by the Governor, was often able to over-ride the Assembly. But there
               was a sturdy independence about many of the less prominent Loyalist pioneers, and a
               measure of infiltration of liberal principles had accompanied their coming,<note

            <p TEIform="p">From the standpoint of educational developments, the chief significance
               of the many controversies between Assembly and Council during this period lies in the
               delaying effect such controversies had on school legislation, and in the partial
               evidence they present of the social distinctions which conditioned the early
               educational foundations of the province. <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified"
                  TEIform="q">The social and intellectual differences between the councillors and
                  the mass of the settlers deprived the Council of a representative character and

               These were most pronounced, of course, at the respective capitals, where there was an
               aristocratic coterie made up of government officials, military and naval officers,
               judges, leading lawyers, higher clergy, and prominent merchants. The rest of the
               inhabitants of the <pb n="41" id="p41" TEIform="pb"/> capital and practically all the

               </note> Our thesis is now clear. The school system of New Brunswick had a slow and
               cautious beginning along traditional lines, uninspired by the democracy to which the
               American experiment was dedicated. At the time (1795) When most of the contestants in
               the American Philosophical Society's essay competition were writing in favor of the
               full and free development of every individual, in order that a true democracy might
               be realized,<note target="n4.38" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">38</hi>
               </note> New Brunswick leaders, delegating to the traditional agencies of Church and
               private initiative a large measure of responsibility for the education of plain folk,
               were thinking in terms of education for their own children, the leaders to be. They
               could not dream that the decorous decades would give way to boisterous years when a
               vigorous democracy would furnish the leaders of the province, leaders who would be
               none the better because of educational deficiencies for which the old order was
               responsible. It is, of course, only fair to note that traditionalism was not
               immediately routed in the United States; only fair, too, to remember that New
               Brunswick was a small province with as yet undeveloped resources, and that its
               leaders were harassed by manifold problems of a wide variety. Moreover, it is
               undeniable that efficient secondary and higher institutions of learning are of the
               utmost importance in any school system, as J. R. Inch, Superintendent of Education in
               New Brunswick from 1891 to 1909, has pointed out in the following words: <q

                  the general rule that in point of time the college and high school have been

                  causes of this order of development, its beneficent effect cannot be doubted.
                  Without effective higher institutions of learning a country cannot hope to
                  maintain for any considerable time a system of common schools in the highest state
                  of efficiency</q>.<note target="n4.39" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </note> What we wish to point out here, however, is that class consciousness played a
               responsible part in the order of development referred to, and in the primary emphasis
               for many years on secondary and higher education.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">New Brunswick schools during the first half-century fall into the old
               familiar pattern. There were schools, partially supported by the state, for the upper
               classes, i.e., the Academy and Grammar Schools; and for the poor, namely the parish
               schools, Indian Schools, and schools under the special aegis of the Church, working
               through the S. P. G. or the National Board. The remaining schools were of the private
               venture type. The total number of schools was inadequate, and the curriculum, for the
               most part, elementary. <pb n="42" id="p42" TEIform="pb"/> The spirit in which the
               leadership of the province conceded government aid to the parish schools was in such
               marked contrast with the spirit in which the Academy was supported that one might
               almost suspect that the parish schools were regarded as schools for paupers. Not
               until 1802, nineteen years after the coming of the Loyalists, was any provision made
               for such schools. When a measure to grant £ 10 to each parish of the province for
               educational purposes was passed as part of the appropriation bill by the Assembly in
               1793, the Council rejected it, stating among other objections 'that the appropriating
               money for the education of children in the different parishes of this Province, was a

            <p TEIform="p">To bracket the Grammar Schools with the Academy as institutions for the
               benefit of the upper classes may require some explanation. Undoubtedly they lacked
               the aristocratic character of the Academy, but the term <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">grammar school</q> indicates that they were
               designed, as in England and the Thirteen Colonies, for the education of children of
               the middle classes, i.e., children whose elementary education was gained at home or
               in private schools, and who were able to continue their schooling beyond the years
               and the curriculum of the parish schools. What Sir Robert Falconer has said of
               similar institutions in Nova Scotia lends support to the view that grammar schools
               may be described as schools for the upper classes. His words on the subject are as
               follows: <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">In pursuance of the policy
                  of supplying opportunities first for that class of the population from which the
                  higher ranks were recruited, the Government of Nova Scotia in 1811 passed a
                  Grammar School Act to provide Grammar Schools in seven counties and in three
                  districts.</q>
               <note target="n4.43" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">43</hi>
               </note> Actually many of the Grammar Schools of New Brunswick fell far short of the
               secondary curriculum they were supposed to follow, deteriorating to the point where
               they did little work beyond that of the parish schools. Yet year after year certain
               favored localities continued to draw the larger grant-in-aid and to enjoy the
               prestige of having a Grammar School.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">While the schools of New Brunswick may be classified in the manner above
               suggested, their development, and the influences which affected that development, can
               be studied most readily from a chronological viewpoint, al- <pb n="43" id="p43"
                  TEIform="pb"/> though at times a clearer understanding may be attained by
               departing from the strictly chronological method.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">Private endeavor resulted in a number of schools antedating the first
               school legislation of 1792. Only a few parents could afford to send their children to
               England, as Edward Winslow did in the case of his eldest son in 1784.<note

               </note> To send them to the United States incurred the risk of republican
               contamination. Some parents taught their children at home, partially at least, as
               Winslow seems to have been forced to do<note target="n4.45" anchored="yes"

               </note> when his brood grew annually, but others lacked the time and the ability, yet
               desired education for their children. There was, therefore, an extensive field for
               private initiative. Many of the resulting schools were of the elementary and
               precarious type referred to in connection with the Pre-Revolutionary period.
               According to the Governor's Royal Instructions of 1784 no one was to keep school in
               New Brunswick without a license from the Governor,<note target="n4.46" anchored="yes"

               </note> but it is likely that in rural areas this formality was often overlooked.
               Information about these schools is scanty. We know that Bealing Stephenson who came
               to Fredericton in 1790 taught school there for forty years, and was accounted an
               accomplished penman and an expert in mathematics.<note target="n4.47" anchored="yes"

               fourteen in the province.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">In the schools of the S. P. G. we have an example of the important place
               which religion and denominationalism occupied in the educational philosophy of the
               eighteenth century. The proselytizing and teaching functions of the society were
               closely related. According to the Royal Instructions, a license from the Lord Bishop
               of London, who supervised the work of the S. P. G., was obligatory for schoolmasters
               coming to New Brunswick from the Mother country.<note target="n4.53" anchored="yes"

               </note> These were mostly Anglican missionaries and were not in sufficient numbers to
               meet the need. Consequently, masters from the best material available in the colony
               were placed on the S. P. G. list of teachers, sometimes on the recommendation of the
               Governor-in-Council, more frequently on the word of the clergyman in charge of the
               parish where a teacher was needed. Cases are on record in which teachers holding the
               Governor's license were placed on the S. P. G. list if they were Anglicans and were
               recommended by the missionary in charge of the parish where they taught. Thus
               Benjamin Snow, who had a school at Carleton in 1784, applied through the Rev. Samuel
               Cooke to be placed on the list of the S. P. G. schoolmasters, was accepted, and

               </note> The requirements of a prospective teacher wishing to be licensed by the S. P.
               G., and the instructions issued to schoolmasters employed by the society reveal
               unequivocally that the educational programme of the S. P. G. <pb n="45" id="p45"
                  TEIform="pb"/> was a subsidiary of the denominational. A teacher wishing to be
               licensed by the S. P. G. must present certificates with respect to his zeal for the
               Christian religion, his affection to. the present Governor, and his conformity to the
               doctrine and discipline of the Church of England, also testimonials of his ability to
               teach the catechism of that church and such exposition thereof as the Society might
               order. In the Standing Orders of the Society instructions relating to the teaching of
               writing and elementary arithmetic were preceded by instructions emphasizing religious
               purposes. Children were to be taught reading in order that they might be able to read
               the Scriptures and other pious books. Masters were to teach their pupils to read the
               Church Catechism, to memorize it, and to understand it by the help of expositions
               sent over by the Society.<note target="n4.56" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

            <p TEIform="p">The activity and influence of the Church of England in the educational
               field were not confined to the schools of the S. P. G. The teachers in the Academy,
               Grammar Schools, and later, in the College of New Brunswick, were Anglicans, and the
               Church of England catechism was taught in the Madras Schools. Moreover, the Anglican
               Church, as in the mother country, assumed that it was the special depositary of
               loyalty and superior breeding. Although an act passed in 1786 for preserving the
               Church of England referred to that church <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified"
                  TEIform="q">as by law established</q>,<note target="n4.57" anchored="yes"

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">57</hi>
               </note> it is doubtful if the Church of England was legally the Established Church of
               New Brunswick. Nevertheless, Anglicans acted on the assumption that it was. Bishop
               John Inglis in a written complaint to the Governor, Sir Howard Douglas, in 1826,
               fulminating against the action of certain Presbyterian trustees of a school at
               Chatham, pointed out that since the provincial law required the teaching of the
               Creed, Lord's Prayer and Ten Commandments, the use of the Anglican catechism was only
               logical, and added <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">indeed if a
                  public school teaches the Established religion of the country, no more can be
                  said</q>. The closing paragraph of the letter is of special interest. The Bishop
               asked Sir Howard if it might not be advisable to add so many members to the bench of
               magistrates at Chatham as would give a majority of Churchmen.<note target="n4.58"

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">58</hi>
               </note> This presumably would, in time, eliminate the offending Presbyterian
               trustees, since at that period the trustees were appointed by the magistrates.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">Anglican control in secondary education has already been mentioned. The
               Academy and later the Collegiate School and College of New Brunswick were practically
               exclusive Anglican institutions, in spite of the fact that they received public
               money. So long as all the high government officials were Anglicans, as they were
               during the early years of the province, Dissenters, although they had the majority in
               numbers, could achieve little success in attempting to change this order of things.
               As a matter of fact, despite Glenie's championship, or perhaps because of it,
               Methodists and Baptists were even unable to secure for their clergy the right to
               solemnize marriages. <note target="n4.59" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

            <p TEIform="p">Dissenters were unable to maintain schools as numerous and as influential
               as the Anglicans during this period, for they lacked the outside support which the
               Church of England received from the S. P. G., were cut off by the Revolution from
               their brethren in the Colonies, and could not count among their numbers as many
               persons of prestige and secure income as could the favored Anglican communion. They
               were not, however, inactive in education before the inauguration of parish schools,
               nor did they depend entirely on those schools when such were established. In 1788 a
               schoolmaster at Carleton reported to the S. P. G. that 'two wealthy Dissenters have

               too, the Society was beginning to see the hopelessness of trying to make the Church
               of England the Established Church in New Brunswick, and to realize that the days of
               Anglican privilege and social prestige were beginning to wane.<note target="n4.64"

            <p TEIform="p">While the S. P. G. held a narrow view of education and an exalted view of
               denominationalism, and while it may have helped to create resentment among other
               denominations and to delay the establishment of free non-sectarian schools, we must
               not overlook the fact that the Society did render a service to elementary education
               at a time when schools of any kind were at a premium, and that those whom it
               commissioned to teach, working under difficulties, must have added appreciably to the
               sum total of knowledge. Those difficulties were far from slight. While the masters

            <p TEIform="p">It is a rather curious anomaly that while Loyalist parents were grieving,
               over the lack of educational facilities for their children, a definite and ambitious
               scheme was being launched in the interests of a group of people who were untroubled
               by their lack of schooling. A few months after Dr. William Paine, urged on by his
               wife, affixed his signature to a memorial praying that steps be taken toward the

               Chief Justice, Provincial Secretary, and others, empowered by the Society for the

            <p TEIform="p">The Society referred to, like the Society for the Propagation of the
               Gospel in Foreign Parts, was an outside agency. Its activities in New Brunswick
               represent an odd assortment of purposes and motives&#8212;Christian philanthropy,
               noblesse oblige, Protestant zeal, and opportunism. The Society, originally chartered
               by the Long Parliament in 1649 as the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in
               New England, was rechartered in the reign of Charles II, and the phrase <q

               the title. The aim of the Society was the propagation of the gospel among the
               Indians, principally in Massachusetts, but its funds, Hannay says, were largely
               appropriated by Harvard College for general education,<note target="n4.70"

               </note> an interesting point in comparison with a certain measure of diversion of
               effort later in New Brunswick. At the close of the Revolution the Society, commonly
               known as the New England Company, concentrated on the redemption of the Indians of
               New Brunswick from Roman Catholicism, migratory habits, and illiteracy. Certainly the
               plight of the Indians of the province might have been expected to arouse pity and a
               sense of responsibility on the part of any Loyalists having a lively memory of their
               own recent dispossession. Winslow admitted that their condition, because of the
               encroachments made on their hunting grounds by the new settlements, was one of abject
               poverty and distress.<note target="n4.71" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">71</hi>
               </note> When to this consideration was added the willingness of the New England
               Company to spend money on Indian schools in New Brunswick, thereby affording a number
               of administrative jobs for several prominent members of the official class, a scheme
               for the improvement and education of the Indians appeared in the light of a duty and
               an opportunity. <pb n="48" id="p48" TEIform="pb"/> A commission was appointed
               empowered to engage and pay teachers for the purpose of civilizing and teaching the

               </note> Schools were established at Woodstock, Fredericton, Sheffield, Westfield, St.
               Andrews, Miramichi, and Sussex Vale. These were presided over by able men, a number
               of them being graduates of American colleges. In 1794 the commissioners, evidently
               realizing that these various schools, while they were of benefit to the Indians as
               relief centres, were failures as educational institutions, decided to close all but
               the one at Sussex Vale under Rev. Oliver Arnold. Winslow, commenting on this decision
               wrote: <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">The erecting of a convenient
                  building at Sussex-Vale, as an academy exclusively for them, the employment of a

                  which were made for their accommodation and comfort, all contributed to soothe
                  them in their state of distress .... They considered this place as an Asylum where
                  the aged and infirm could rest from the fatigues which are incident to savage
                  life, and where the young of both sexes were fed, clothed and instructed as far as

               </note> A degree of contrast to this picture of pleased and grateful natives occurs
               in Thomas Costin's letter to Winslow in 1804, a letter in which the writer spoke of
               the Saint John river Indians as distressed and discontented, and missing the relief
               afforded by the various schools which had been closed. Of the school at Sussex Vale,

               in the supplies of provisions and clothing than in the benefits of education. A
               report of the school at Woodstock shows that during a six-month period only $ 3.30
               was spent for books and writing paper while $ 529.12 was expended for food and

                  schools or chastisement for faults. To reconcile them to the latter it was
                  proposed to introduce into the same school with them a certain number of the white
                  children of the neighborhood, in order that the savages might mix with them and
                  observe that they were treated with equal justice and attention.</q>

               </note> This device appears not unreasonable but one cannot help wondering if it was
               not resorted to in the interests of the white children rather than in the interests
               of the Indians. Not that one can strongly censure people who were deprived of schools
               for their own children for seeking to take advantage of excellent facilities provided
               for unappreciative Indians.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">If officials of the Company outside of the provincial agents were not
               aware of this diversion of the Company's accommodations, a letter in 1824 from the
               Governor, Sir Howard Douglas, to Mr. Vaughan, the chairman of the New England
               Company, must have proved something of a shock. Sir Howard wrote that he found the
               school, not, as he expected, an Establishment specially devoted to the improvement
               and education of the Indians, but exhibiting them as last in the order in which were
               presented to him, to his surprise, a great concourse of other children of the first
               condition in the neighborhood. The plan, he thought, had failed and he was not afraid
               to breathe surprise that <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q"
                  >expectations of improving the moral condition of people who stand in the very

                  tempting the parent to sell the child, transplanting the Infant into a new
                  condition, too forced and unnatural to be permanent, and subject consequently to
                  let him relapse into savage life to Parents, with habits that do not suit that
                  condition</q>. His Excellency suggested that the Indians must be brought gradually
               to such habits of agricultural industry as might induce them to establish their
               residences in tracts of reserved lands which had been appropriated to them and which
               might also admit of their young men following the desultory pursuits from which they
               could not seem to be detached. As the civilization of the country advanced they would
               be forced more and more to the cultivation of their fixed resources, and at proper
               periods in this gradual progress provincial leaders must watch out for the best
               opportunities and means, such as schools, of improving their moral and religious
               condition. Anything else would be <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q"

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">80</hi>
               </note> and the Company ceased its operations in the province. Altogether $ 140,000
               had been spent, of which $ 40,000 had gone to officials whose jobs were practically
               sinecures. For instance, the Honorable John Coffin received £ 125 sterling per year
               as superintendent of the Sussex School, although he lived <pb n="50" id="p50"

               </note> and probably did not see the school even annually. The whole enterprise,
               because of its failure to make any deep or lasting impression on the Indians of New
               Brunswick, scarcely deserves the attention here given it, but as an example of
               energetic but injudicious expenditure on the part of a wealthy outside agency, in
               comparison with the sluggish and inadequate provisions within the province for the
               bulk of the population of school age, it presents an interesting contrast.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">In the same year in which the New England Company began its operations in
               the interests of the Indians of New Brunswick, definite steps were taken towards the
               establishment of the Fredericton Academy. We have noted that this Academy was the
               first institution of learning in New Brunswick to claim the attention of the
               legislature. The germ of the idea back of the school was in the minds of certain
               Loyalists before the migration. In New York, in 1783, a Plan of a Religious and
               Literary Institution for Nova Scotia was formulated and discussed by a committee
               including the Rev. Charles Inglis, afterwards the first Bishop of Nova Scotia, and
               Jonathan Odell, later the first provincial secretary of New Brunswick. A memorial to
               Sir Guy Carleton stressed the expediency of a Public Seminary, Academy or College at
               some <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">centrical</q> part of Nova
               Scotia, and a later letter from the originators of the plan declared that the
               founding on a liberal plan of such an institution where youth could receive a

                  importance.<note target="n4.83" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

            <p TEIform="p">The division of Nova Scotia in 1784 into two provinces brought about the
               first step in that decentralization of effort which has been a lamentable feature of
               educational endeavor in the Maritime Provinces. Largely through the efforts of
               Inglis, an Academy at Windsor was begun in 1787, and in 1789 was raised to the status
               of a college. In the case of the New Brunswick Academy emphasis on the function of
               such an institution as a training ground for clergymen was not quite so decided as in
               connection with Windsor Academy, but that may be due to the fact that lack of
               communication prevented Bishop Inglis from exercising much influence in this distant
               part of his diocese. The spirit, however, was appreciably the same as that revealed
               in a casual statement in the early records of Windsor 'that in exact proportion to
               the influence of the established religion will be the immovable loyalty of the
               inhabitants of the province'.<note target="n4.84" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

            <p TEIform="p">The Fredericton Academy was founded at about the same time as the one at
               Windsor. In the records of the Council of New Brunswick there is a minute dated
               December 13, 1785, reporting consideration of a memorial of Dr. William Paine and

               that the Academy and a parish school were horses of a different color. The effect of
               the deadlock between the two Houses was to delay any further legislative aid to the

            <p TEIform="p">In 1800, the year after the deadlock between Council and Assembly ended,
               the Academy became incorporated as the College of New Brunswick. Its story from then
               on is a part of the history of higher education, but a preparatory school was

               </note> and when the college became King's College in 1829 this school became the
               Fredericton Collegiate School, supported partly by University funds and partly as a
               provincial grammar school.<note target="n4.99" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">99</hi>
               </note> The greater part of the history of the Collegiate School belongs to a later
               period, but the inauguration of the school may legitimately be dealt with here.
               According to the regulations adopted by the College Council in 1829 for the
               government of the Collegiate School, the institution was to include a Grammar School,
               and an English School, under the superintendence of the Principal Preceptor of the
               Grammar School, the latter to hold no church preferment which might interfere with
               his scholastic duty of preparing candidates for matriculation. The English master was
               to teach the pupils under his charge Reading, Writing, the rudiments of English
               Grammar, Geography and History, Arithmetic, Practical Geometry, and Book-keeping, and
               was also to instruct the classical pupils in such of the foregoing branches as the
               Principal Preceptor might consider necessary. The tuition for classical pupils was to
               be £ 6 per annum, £ 1 of which was to be paid to the English master for every scholar
               from the classical department whom be instructed. Tuition for pupils of the English
               school was set at £ 4 per annum. Aside from the tuition fee, the only qualification
               for admittance was the ability of the candidate to read a chapter in the Bible. The
               daily exercises of the school were to commence and conclude with prayers according to
               the Anglican form. The Visiting Committee, which consisted of the College Professors,
               had the power to admit free scholars, provided <pb n="53" id="p53" TEIform="pb"/>
               that no more than six such scholars were in attendance at the school at any one
                  time.<note target="n4.100" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

            </p>

            <p TEIform="p">The regulations relating to tuition, and the close connection between the
               school and King's College, which was an aristocratic sectarian institution, tended to
               limit the benefits of the school to a select few and bred a snobbish spirit. Lt.-Col.
               William Baird, referring to his attendance at this school in the 1830's, wrote: <q
                  rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">Many of the boys were sons of the
                  so-called aristocracy of that day, and Segee and myself were subjected to no small
                  amount of taunts and sneers, at and after the competitive examinations which twice
                  in each year were held on the hill at King's College . . . . The school was
                  divided by the scions of aristocracy . . . into two classes; and the Plebei thus
                  proscribed were made to suffer many indignities.</q>

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">101</hi>
               </note> The writer did not say whether he and Segee were numbered among the free
               scholars or not. If they were not, then the position of those who were must have been
               an unhappy one! Leaving the Collegiate School for the present, we turn back to the
               period of the first Pa rish School Act (1802). According to Professor S. D. Clark,
               who has studied social developments in Canada, <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified"
                  TEIform="q">in New Brunswick the frontier phase of development had no more than
                  set in by 1800</q>, using the word <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified"
                  TEIform="q">frontier</q> to mean an area in which expansion of new forms of
               economic enterprise is taking place.<note target="n4.102" anchored="yes"

               </note> It would seem, then, that the tardiness and tentative nature of educational
               developments were facets of a general slow development. Dugald Campbell's survey of
               New Brunswick for the year 1802 reveals the lack of bridges, and the fact that there
               were not ten miles of road fit for wheel carriage in the entire province, <q

               </note> As for trade, it was becoming all too apparent that New Brunswick could not
               meet the commercial role assigned to it by sanguine imperialists at the time of the
               disruption of the Old Empire. Not only were the requirements of the West Indian trade
               beyond the resources and business arrangements of New Brunswick, but experience was
               also proving the dependence of the province on the United States for many
                  staples.<note target="n4.104" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">104</hi>
               </note> We can note only some of the factors in all the intricacies of the situation.
               On one hand was Britain's traditional colonial policy, and the desire of ardent
               imperialists to treat the United States as a foreign country and to make her pay the
               piper for the Revolution.<note target="n4.105" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">105</hi>
               </note> Added to this was the eagerness of the remaining British colonies to
               monopolize imperial markets, and to reap the benefits of the exclusion of the United
               States from the West Indies. On the other hand, in the negotiations of 1783 the
               United States had obtained for her fishermen the valuable privilege of fishing in
               British-American waters,<note target="n4.106" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">106</hi>
               </note> and was anxious to gain re-entrance to the West <pb n="54" id="p54"

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">107</hi>
               </note> Moreover, Britain could not entirely ignore the United States because British
               North America was not an adequate substitute as a source of raw materials, and
               because the American market was too vital to Britain to be endangered by any policy
               favoring colonial interests at the expense of foreign trade. Britain's colonial
               policy toward her North American provinces was, therefore, affected by her policy
               toward the United States and was sometimes sacrificed to it.<note target="n4.108"

               </note> Before the Revolution, Nova Scotia had had only a minor trade with the West
               Indies in fish. After the war, the Maritime Provinces failed to meet the needs of the
               West Indies, especially after 1793, when Britain, at war with France, had to divert
               much of her shipping from the islands. As a result, the governors of the West Indies
               were allowed to open their ports to American vessels, if necessary, and thus the
               special privileges of the northern provinces were largely wiped out.<note

               </note> While the Maritime Provinces strenuously advocated the exclusion of Americans
               from the West Indian markets, they themselves, needing American goods, often found a
               relaxation of the navigation laws desirable and necessary, and as long as British
               shipping bad the monopoly of the carriage, as it did until the American embargo of
               1808, Whitehall was not unduly perturbed.<note target="n4.110" anchored="yes"

               </note> A considerable volume of clandestine trade was carried on between New
               Brunswick and New England, facilitated by the indefiniteness of the boundary, the
               many islands in the Passamaquoddy Bay, the privileges of American fishermen in
               British coastal waters, the scarcity of patrol boats, the amenability of customs
               officials to bribery, and the connivance of the people on both sides. George Leonard,
               the Maritime Superintendent of Trade and Fisheries, his son, and his deputies fought
               a more or less losing battle against smuggling in the latter part of the eighteenth

               </note> The point is, that economic need, propinquity, past experience, and perhaps
               blood connections made trade between New Brunswick and New England a natural process,

               relation to the West Indian trade throw a good deal of light on conditions in the
               province at the opening of the nineteenth century. Capital was scarce and skilled
               labourers few. In their struggle to capture the West Indian trade from the United
               States, the Maritime Provinces <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">were

               Why should he <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">sacrifice good wages,
                  and, like the French coureur de bois, the freedom of a seasonal occupation for the

            <p TEIform="p">Bearing all this in mind, one has some justification for believing that
               New Brunswick, at the turn of the century, was just barely getting along. Conditions
               proving too much for the baffled and the restless, there occurred the beginning of

               immigration. Not until after the close of the Napoleonic Wars did the province
               attract new settlers, and when they did come they created many problems.</p>

               </note> at the opening of the nineteenth century. There was not yet abroad in the
               land a <pb n="56" id="p56" TEIform="pb"/> theory of popular education. Those best
               aware of the advantages of learning thought of it in terms of class distinction,
               denominationalism, and charity. Unable to conceive of the masses as potential rulers
               of the country, they could contemplate an uneducated people with regret, but without
               alarm. As a result, school legislation in this period was uninspired and inadequate,
               a haphazard fiddling with a problem which was viewed as a minor one.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">As debates in the Assembly were not reported in the early years of the
               province, and the Minutes of the Executive Council do not include discussion, we
               cannot know what was said about the Parish School Act of 1802. Early newspapers also
               made no reference to it, nor is it mentioned in any of Winslow's letters. The Act was
               practically the same measure which had been rejected by the Council in 1793.<note

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">129</hi>
               </note> Besides, even the Council must have realized that something had to be done if
               succeeding generations of the original Loyalists were not to be vastly inferior to
               the first. In assenting to the bill the Council more or less acknowledged this, for
               the preamble of the Act reads: <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q"
                  >Whereas, The education of children is of the utmost importance to their future
                  usefulness in society: and whereas, The situation of many parents in the different
                  parishes of the province renders them unable to procure for their children the
                  benefits of instruction in reading and writing without the aid of the
                  Legislature,</q> etc. The, main clause of the bill appropriated £ 420 for
               distribution among the parishes of the province for educational purposes, £ 10 to
               each parish.<note target="n4.130" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">130</hi>
               </note> These sums were not large but neither were the provincial funds.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">Those who framed the Act of 1802 took advantage of existing machinery for
               the licensing of teachers. According to the Royal Instructions issued to Carleton in
               1784, a prospective teacher obtained a license to teach by applying to the Governor.
               It is probable that such requests were seldom refused at first in view of the
               scarcity of teachers. Because of this, and because there was no system of inspection,
               there could be little real guarantee of a teacher's abilities or morals. In a pioneer
               country one of the basic problems of education lies in the dearth of capable
               teachers. In failing to grapple seriously with this problem at an early date the
               legislators of New Brunswick assured the province of a travesty of education for
               decades, thereby depreciating the value of schooling in the eyes of the people and
               delaying the growth of a popular demand for it.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">The Parish School Act of 1802 also proposed to make use of existing
               machinery in the matter of the distribution of the provincial grant. The township,
               generally the local unit in New England, had been the civil division in Nova Scotia,
               and the word township occurs in the Royal Instructions to Carle- <pb n="57" id="p57"
                  TEIform="pb"/> ton in 1784, Sections 43 and 49 ordering that lands in or near each
               township be set apart for a school, and for the maintenance of a clergyman and a
                  teacher.<note target="n4.131" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">131</hi>
               </note> But the Royal Instructions also commanded that the Province be divided into
               such Parishes and Counties as might be thought expedient.<note target="n4.132"
                  anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">132</hi>
               </note> Thus the parish became the civil division instead of the township, a small
               shift, but one in line with the renewed emphasis on the British connection. The chief
               parish officer was the Justice of the Peace, and the Justices of all the parishes of
               a county met as a Court of the General Sessions. It was to the Justices of the
               General Sessions in the different counties that the sum granted by the Legislature
               was to be paid in trust, to be allotted by them in their discretion at the rate of £
               10 per parish, so as to induce the establishment of schools where necessary, and to
               assist schools already in existence. The Justices were to report at the next session
               of the General Assembly how the money had been expended, and how far the expenditure
               had answered the purposes contemplated. As there were no school trustees, the ten
               pounds was to be paid directly to the teacher of a school as part of his salary, the
               rest to be subscribed by the parents whose children attended the school.<note
                  target="n4.133" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">133</hi>
               </note> It was suggested in an anonymous political tract, dealing with the refusal of
               the Council in 1793 to pass a bill similar to this act, that one of the Council's
               objections centred around this question of the control of school money by the
               Justices. As the members of the Assembly were almost without exception Justices, the
               Council feared that the Assembly would practically control the expenditure of school
               money, thereby rendering the grant <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q"
                  >popularity money</q> to be expended by the members for their own advantage.<note
                  target="n4.134" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">134</hi>
               </note> It is quite likely that sometimes the various sections of a parish did
               contend for the grant of £ 10. In deciding which locality should be the privileged
               one, it may be that those Justices who happened to be members of the Assembly were
               influenced by political considerations. Certainly there is evidence that the question
               of school grants at a later date did become a political football.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">The Act of 1802 made no provision for the building of school houses.
               According to the Royal Instructions lands were to be reserved for school purposes,
               and in the Minutes of the Council a number of applications for such lands are
               recorded. For instance, in 1787 the Justices of the Peace of Charlotte County were
               granted 1460 acres for a glebe and school.<note target="n4.135" anchored="yes"
                  TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">135</hi>
               </note> This was probably for an Anglican Church and school, as that favored church
               seems to have been in receipt, in the province at large, of extensive tracts of
                  land.<note target="n4.136" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">136</hi>
               </note> It would appear that comparatively few communities obtained land and built
               school houses, for when the Common School Act was passed in 1871 only a fraction of
               the then-existing trustee boards owned what school buildings there were. Since
               schools could not spring up out of the ground like mushrooms, and since few lands in
               this thinly populated province could bring in revenue in the form <pb n="58" id="p58"
                  TEIform="pb"/> of rents, school lands were of little use to people too poor or too
               indifferent to spend money on school buildings. Sometimes the community used whatever
               was available; sometimes the teachers rented a vacant room or building, or used their
               own homes.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">The Act of 1802, whatever its inadequacies, did create a precedent for
               state assistance to schools of the rural areas, where private schools and schools
               operated by the S. P. G. were much less common than in the more populated sections of
               the province. The Act has been described as marking <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">a change in the feelings of the people toward
                  education</q>.<note target="n4.137" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">137</hi>
               </note> Actually it seems truer to say that it marked the beginning of some slight
               responsibility on the part of the provincial leaders for the education of <q

            <p TEIform="p">The College and the parish schools having been established, it was now
               the turn of the grammar schools. In 1803, a committee of the Assembly was ordered to
               prepare a bill for establishing <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q"
                  >County</q> schools, but the bill failed to pass,<note target="n4.138"

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">138</hi>
               </note> for reasons not known. There was no session of the legislature in 1804, but
               in 1805 County Schools became the subject of legislation. At this time the province
               was administered by Gabriel G. Ludlow, the senior member of the Council, Governor
               Carleton being on leave in England. Ludlow, to the disgust of officials in
               Fredericton, persisted in residing at Saint John,<note target="n4.139" anchored="yes"
                  TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">139</hi>
               </note> a city which had resented the choice of Fredericton as capital and as the
               site of the Academy and College. Whether there was any connection between Ludlow and
               the Bill of 1805 is not clear. Ward Chipman, writing to Winslow in 1805 merely noted
               that <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">the school-bill is again
                  revived, has passed the House, and will, I understand, be assented to by the

            <p TEIform="p">The Act of 1805,<note target="n4.141" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">141</hi>
               </note> curiously entitled <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">An Act
                  for Encouraging and Extending Literature in This Province</q>, made provision
               first of all for a Grammar School at Saint John. The tendency in the province to
               regard the Church of England as the rightful supervisor of the upper levels of
               education was revealed by the clause which made the Rector of Trinity Church in the
               City the President, by law, of the Board of Directors. An annual grant of £ 100 was
               to be applied towards the salary of the master, and a like sum was to be used by the
               Board of Directors for erecting or buying a building. This Board was to account to
               the Legislature from time to time for the conduct and management of the property
               vested in them. The Act further provided that two County Schools be established in
               each of the Counties of Westmorland, Charlotte, Northumberland, Queens, York, and
               Sunbury, and one in the only other county of the province at the time, Saint John,
               the Saint John Grammar School to take the place of a second County School there.
               These schools were for the instruction of both sexes in the English language, writing
               and arithmetic. They were to be under the direction and control of the Justices of
               the Peace. These officials, sitting in General Sessions for their respective
               counties, were to appoint <pb n="59" id="p59" TEIform="pb"/> the masters and, when
               necessary, to dismiss them. To finance these schools the sum of £ 375 was to be
               granted annually for six years, £ 25 to the Justices of Saint John County, and £ 50
               to the Justices of each of the remaining counties. Thus each master would receive £
               25 annually.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">These schools were to be visited semi-annually by the rectors or
               missionaries of the parishes where they happened to be, together with committees
               appointed for that purpose by the Courts of the General Sessions, to whom the
               committees were to report. There could be as many as four free scholars in a school,
               and eight in the case of Saint John Grammar School. The most interesting provision of
               the Act stipulated that the County Schools were to be held in the various parishes of
               the counties in rotation, until each parish had received the benefit of the school.
               No County School could be held in Saint John City or parish, which were served by the
               Saint John Grammar School, or in Fredericton, which had the benefit of the Grammar
               School in connection with the College. As we have seen, the <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">moving</q> school had sometimes been a feature in
               New England. Those who framed the Act of 1805 may have remembered this colonial
               practice and have resorted to it in order to serve as many communities as possible.
               Whatever the benefits of the plan, it certainly could not foster continuity of
               schooling or promote the establishment of permanent school buildings.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">Theoretically, New Brunswick now had two kinds of schools&#8212;the parish
               schools, to teach the rudiments, and the County schools, evidently intended to be of
               a superior type, since the masters received a larger grant, and there was more
               immediate supervision. It was a long time, however, before the County Schools had a
               distinct function in fact as well as in intention.<note target="n4.142"

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">142</hi>
               </note> More than that, for a decade after the passage of the Act, the Counties
               failed to take advantage of its provisions, only the Grammar School at Saint John
               coming into actual operation. It may be that the people were indifferent, and the
               justices, busy with other things, may have failed to show energy in promoting
               schools. Possibly the principle of moving the school proved unacceptable. At any
               rate, when a new Grammar School Act was passed in 1816 there was no mention of
               circulating schools, and Boards of Trustees replaced the Justices of the Peace as
               Directors of the Grammar Schools.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">Throughout Governor Carleton's prolonged absence during the interval
               between the Act of 1805 and the three school acts of 1816, the government of the
               province was administered by a series of presidents and military officers. The
               arrangement by which the senior military officer of the province became the
               administrator, an arrangement probably due to the possibilities of war with the
               United States,<note target="n4.143" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               months in 1808.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">During this period there was, as we might expect, considerable emphasis
               on things military. Militia bills, defence measures, recruiting, and drilling were
               subjects of discussion and legislation, and objects of expenditure. But the
               opposition of New England to the War of 1812 meant that the Maritimes were safe from
               attack by land,<note target="n4.146" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               untouched as a theatre of war, the effects of these conflicts on her trade, industry,
               and prosperity were momentous.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">We have already noted that under pressure of war with France, Britain had
               practically suspended the Navigation Acts to allow American participation in the West
               Indian trade. Merchants of the Maritime Provinces were much displeased, and bombarded
               the Home Authorities with memorials.<note target="n4.148" anchored="yes"

               soared. Ward Chipman, writing to Winslow from Saint John in February, 1805, declared:
                  <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">I hope the exclusion of the
                  Americans from our West India Islands will give a spring to our commerce and a new

               </note> That was in 1807. By 1809 the picture had changed. The American government,
               irritated by Britain's insistence on the right of search as part of the
               counter-measures against Napoleon's blockade, in 1808 placed an embargo on American
               trade with British colonies. At once this accelerated the trade of the Maritimes with
               the West Indies. As these British colonies could not, however, supply West Indian
               requirements without the aid of the United States, Britain declared certain maritime
               ports, including Saint John, free ports, and virtually <pb n="61" id="p61"

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">152</hi>
               </note> The effect on the trade and shipping of New Brunswick was marked. Soon New
               Brunswick ships were busy trading with New England, and transporting to the West
               Indies American goods and such Maritime products as were available for export,
               chiefly lumber. Because of the embargo, this New Brunswick-New England trade was
               illegal from the American standpoint, but New England was opposed to the embargo, and
               American officials could not halt a brisk contraband trade, especially in
               Passamaquoddy Bay. Even the hostilities of the War of 1812 affected commercial
               relations but little, for New England opposed the war almost to the point of
               secession. To New Brunswick, strategically placed beside a friendly enemy, the war
               brought prosperity. Britain, concerned for the welfare of the West Indies, and
               anxious to keep an American market open for British manufactures, purposely avoided
               blockading the coast of New England until the last year of the war, leaving the
               merchants of the Maritime Provinces a virtual monopoly of the existing American
               import trade in British manufactures.<note target="n4.153" anchored="yes"

               </note> The close of the war caused much Maritime anxiety lest the Americans be
               allowed re-entry into the West Indies. Because Britain did exclude American trade,
               the United States instituted a number of counter-measures detrimental to British
               colonial trade and to British mercantile interests. For this reason, and because
               laissez-faire theory and practice were gaining ground as factory industry expanded,
               British rigidity had to give way, and in 1822 a compromise effected the resumption of
               legitimate trade between British North America and the United States.<note

            <p TEIform="p">In the meantime, New Brunswick trade with the Old Country had grown
               enormously, an event also traceable to Napoleon's Continental System, which shut
               Britain off from a supply of Baltic timber, hitherto vital to the British navy and
               merchant fleet. Britain now turned to her American colonies, and between 1809 and
               1812 increased the colonial preference on timber steeply enough to offset the high
               freights across the Atlantic. <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">With
                  one great stroke of fortune British North America had found its justification and
                  acquired its economic rights in the Empire. In their own weakness, the northern
                  colonies had relied on Great Britain, and now, in its own temporary embarrassment,
                  Great Britain had been obliged to fall back on them . . . . Timber, the
                  inexhaustible material, became virtually the sole support of New Brunswick.</q>

            <p TEIform="p">The fact that the revenue in 1815 was four times as great as in 1811, and

               </note> must have had some bearing on the attention paid to education by the
               Legislature in 1816. The interest of the President, Major-General George Stracey
               Smythe, may have been a factor too. The personal support which he gave to the Madras
               Schools a little later shows that the concern which he voiced in his opening speech,
               in 1816, for the promotion of education in the province, was no mere formal
               expression. For ten years the educational system had rested. The only development in
               that time, that of the Sunday School,<note target="n4.161" anchored="yes"

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">161</hi>
               </note> had been outside the system, and, in a sense, outside the educational field.
               Now, in 1816, three acts relating to education appeared upon the statute books.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">One of these established a grammar school at St. Andrews, on terms very
               similar to those regulating the Saint John Grammar School. The fact that St. Andrews
               exhibited greater interest and energy than other county towns suggests the
               interesting speculation that its proximity to the American border may have been a
               factor, the more so as Winslow wrote in 1810: <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified"

                  rend="sup" TEIform="hi">165</hi> The second bill before the House in 1816 came
               from a second attempt to found County schools, or Grammar schools, as they were

                  TEIform="q">An Act to establish Grammar Schools in the several Counties of this
                  Province</q>. This act provided for one Grammar School per county. A new feature
               was the power lodged in the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council to appoint three Trustees
               or Directors for the purpose of establishing Grammar Schools in each of the counties
               except York, Saint John and Charlotte, those counties being already served by such
               schools. Various clauses defined the duties and respon- <pb n="63" id="p63"
                  TEIform="pb"/> sibilities of the Trustees with reference to choosing a site for
               the school, receiving donations, hiring teachers, making bye-laws, holding public
               visitations, and admitting free scholars. There was no change in the regulations
               relating to the licensing of teachers. The grant-in-aid was raised from the
               twenty-five pounds provided in the Act of 1805 to £ 100. This sum was to be paid on
               the certification of the Trustees to the Lieutenant-Governor that a building and
               master had been provided, and that £ 100 had been subscribed by the inhabitants. A
               definite course of study was prescribed consisting of English Grammar, the Latin and
               Greek languages, Orthography and use of the globes, and the practical branches of
               Mathematics, or such other useful knowledge as might be judged necessary.<note
                  target="n4.166" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">166</hi>
               </note> This course, if it had been followed, would have raised these schools above
               the level of the parish schools, and would have fulfilled the intention of the act to
               provide each county with a secondary school. Repeated investigation, however, showed
               that these schools did not come up to standard for many years, for reasons which may
               be noted later.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">There are several possible reasons why the oversight of the Grammar
               Schools was transferred from the Justices of the Peace to a Board of Trustees. In the
               first place, the Justices had failed to get action under the Act of 1805, probably
               because they were busy with other duties, including a number in connection with
               Parish Schools. Secondly, the Saint John Grammar School had been functioning for ten
               years under a Board of Trustees, although actually this was no certain guarantee of
               the efficiency of such a board in less urban districts. Lastly, in 1811 the
               neighboring province of Nova Scotia had placed its county grammar schools under
               trustee boards appointed by the Lt.-Governor-in-Council. This may have been the
               deciding factor. In fact, on comparing the two acts we find other points of identity.
               That clause of the New Brunswick Act of 1816 which dealt with the course of study is
               word for word the same as a similar clause in the Nova Scotia Act of 1811, and the
               clauses of the two acts relating to free scholars are very similar.<note
                  target="n4.167" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">167</hi>
               </note> We shall often find an element of imitativeness about New Brunswick school
               legislation. In general, legislators of the province do not seem to have been much
               concerned with educational philosophies or abstract theories, but they did tend to
               adopt procedures and devices which the experience of other countries had indicated
               might work in New Brunswick. This tendency naturally has meant a lag in progress, but
               perhaps it has saved the province from hasty experiments, fads, and extremes.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">The third act which passed in 1816 dealt with Parish schools. These
               schools, too, were to be under Boards of Trustees whose duties were generally similar
               to those of the Grammar School Trustees, but who were to be appointed by the Justices
               and were to report to the Court of General Sessions. The amazing feature of the act
               was the introduction of the assessment principle. The Trustees were to summon a
               meeting of the inhabitants on fifteen days notice, for the purpose of subscribing
               money for the establishment of schools or of voting to raise it by assessment. Only
               freeholders, or people with an in- <pb n="64" id="p64" TEIform="pb"/> come of 40s.,
               could vote. If the Trustees failed to call such a meeting, the Justices could do so
               at the request of five freeholders. Only the children of parents contributing to the
               support of the school could attend, unless the assessment principle were adopted.
               Upon certificate stating that a building was provided, a capable master appointed,
               and £ 30 raised by the inhabitants of the parish, £ 20 from the provincial treasury
               was to be granted, and a like proportion for any sum not exceeding £ 90, but no one
               school was to receive more than £ 20 in one year, and no larger sum than £ 60 would
               be paid to the schools of one parish. In other words, the number of assisted schools
               in a parish was limited to three.<note target="n4.168" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">168</hi>
               </note> How the assessment principle came to be adopted so early in New Brunswick
               cannot be very satisfactorily explained. It is true that workhouse schools in England
               had been provided for by the general taxation of all property since the middle of the
               eighteenth century,<note target="n4.169" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">169</hi>
               </note> and that thinking people in the United States were beginning to recognize
               that the only safe reliance of a system of state schools lay in the general and
               direct taxation of all property.<note target="n4.170" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">170</hi>
               </note> It is also true that the use of license taxes, local taxes, and rate bills in
               New England recognized the principle of taxation in a sense,<note target="n4.171"
                  anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">171</hi>
               </note> and that the Act of 1811 in Nova Scotia had recommended the principle of
               assessment, but these were feeble and isolated examples for a conservative and
               cautious state to follow, especially when there was no strong sense of educational
               consciousness among the people to act as a spur.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">If the introduction of assessment as an option was a test case, the test
               revealed no inclination on the part of the people in favor of such a method of
               supporting schools. Not a parish tried it, and in 1818 permission to assess was
               removed, on the grounds that experience had proved that it was inexpedient to allow
               the towns and parishes to raise money in this way.<note target="n4.172"
                  anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">172</hi>
               </note> Since the experience was negative, it is hard to see the proof of the
               inexpediency referred to. Possibly local controversies, centering around the question
               of whether to assess or not to assess, created discord which retarded the
               establishment of schools. At any rate, the assessment principle disappeared from New
               Brunswick school legislation for over thirty years, and assessment did not become
               compulsory for fifty-five years.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">Another interesting feature of the Bill of 1816 was the authority it gave
               to the Trustees to remove or expel scholars of abandoned or wicked habits. The
               Trustees might also use 20s. for each school for prizes, for excellence in
               Orthography, Reading, Writing, and Arithmetic, provided that no reward were given any
               scholar unable to repeat by heart the Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the Ten
               Commandments. <note target="n4.173" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">173</hi>
               </note> A clause charging the Trustees to use their best endeavors to cause the youth
               of the parish to attend school indicated an alarming indifference to the benefits of
               such education as was available, a recognition on the part of the legislature of that
               apathy, and a growing concern about it. Evidently there had happened in New Brunswick
               what <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">Investigator</q> feared would
               occur <pb n="65" id="p65" TEIform="pb"/> in Nova Scotia. This correspondent, writing
               to the Acadian Recorder in January, 1818, said: 'The infant state of this country,
               has hitherto rendered an extensive attention to the business of education
               impracticable: men struggling for food have little time to spend upon the pursuits of
               Literature. But there is a danger that the modes of thinking and habits, which arise
               out of such a state of society, may remain long after it is past: and imperceptibly
               enfeeble the community, amidst increasing means of energy.'<note target="n4.174"
                  anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">174</hi>
               </note> Unfortunately, that is what had happened in New Brunswick. Interest in
               education had not kept pace with increasing means. On the contrary, a people deprived
               of education for a generation had come to regard it as unnecessary for <q
                  rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">getting on</q>, an attitude
               concurred in by illiterate immigrants who began to arrive in large numbers after
               Waterloo. This popular indifference continued to curse New Brunswick almost down to
               recent times.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">For a score of years after the Act of 1818 the most vigorous efforts to
               combat illiteracy in the province were linked with the promotion of the Madras
               Schools. We have noted the failure of the introduction of the assessment principle to
               effect an increase in the number of schools. Meanwhile, the number of uneducated
               people in the province was mounting, for reasons which may be now briefly noted. The
               failure of the crops in 1816, and the influence of the lumber industry in drawing
               vigorous young men from the farms had focused attention on the desirability of
               increasing the agricultural population. In 1816 the legislature voted £ 1000 to
               encourage immigration, and the autumn of that year saw the beginning of a process of
               immigration, of which the primary cause was the unfavorable economic conditions in
               Britain at the close of the Napoleonic Wars.<note target="n4.175" anchored="yes"

               </note> At the same time the province received some five hundred slaves, who had fled
               from the southern states to British warships engaged in operations off the southern
               coast of the United States during the War of 1812.<note target="n4.176"

               </note> Coincident with all this was the rise to popularity in England of the
               monitorial system of instruction, a system already referred to. Of the two school
               societies employing the system, namely, the National Society for the Promotion of
               Education of the Poor, and the British and Foreign School Society, it was the former,
               imbued with the missionary zeal of the Anglican Church, which introduced and promoted
               the system in New Brunswick. Missionaries of the S. P. G., already in the field, had
               been for some time encouraging the Society's schoolmasters to conduct their schools
               along the lines advocated by the National Society. The initial steps in the
               introduction of the system into New Brunswick were taken in 1814, when 500 sets of
               books used in the National Schools of Britain were sent to Halifax for free
               distribution amongst the schools of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.<note

               </note> In 1817, Major-General George Stracey Smythe, who had been President of New
               Brunswick since 1812 except for a short interval, was called to Nova Scotia in his
               military capacity, and was in Halifax when he was ap- <pb n="66" id="p66"

               </note> It is not unlikely that his interest in the Madras system was kindled during
               his stay in Halifax. In 1816 the Society sent out Rev. James Milne and a Mr. West to
               promote the system in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, and in 1820 the latter gentleman
               opened a training school for teachers in Halifax. Governor Smythe was so impressed by
               the possibilities of the method for New Brunswick that he gave his patronage to the
               formation of a society for the promotion of this type of school in the province.<note

               funds permitted.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">In the establishment of Madras Schools in New Brunswick several familiar
               threads in the Loyalist pattern of education can be discerned. First of all, we note
               again an outside agency working in the province in the interests of the Church of
               England. Secondly, these schools, although established in the nineteenth century,
               were of eighteenth-century origin, for they were primarily schools for the poor,
               established in the spirit of philanthropy and religion. But with these schools
               several new threads appeared in the educational pattern. Since a number of the Madras
               Schools were conducted by females, the idea of women in the role of teachers gained a
               wider acceptance than it had hitherto known. Eventually, of course, this would have
               happened anyway, but the Madras Schools do seem to have helped to popularize the
               idea. Then, too, Governor Smythe's connection with these schools marked the beginning
               of gubernatorial interest and influence in New Brunswick education. Lt.-Governor
               Carleton, it is true, had helped to promote the Fredericton Academy, but that was an
               exclusive school. To reconcile Governor Smythe's activity in education with the
               character assigned to him by Hannay is not easy. If he had no correct idea of the
               feelings of the people whom he governed, and lacked sympathy with their views, if the
               leading feature of his policy was <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q"
                  >the maintenance of the old system by which the Province had been misgoverned for
                  thirty-five years</q>,<note target="n4.181" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">181</hi>
               </note> then it may be that he thought of schools for the common people in terms of
               benevolent condescension, noblesse oblige, and Church of England policy. Whatever his
               motives, his interest in the Madras Schools seems to have been genuine. A talented
               musician, he often instructed the boys in the Central School, in Saint John in
               singing, and when present at the opening of the school presided at the organ.<note

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">182</hi>
               </note> Moreover, to encourage this school as much as possible, and to remove the
               stigma attached to the Madras Schools as designed primarily for children of the
               indigent, Governor Smythe sent his own son, Brunswick, to the Central School.<note

               any rate, dating from his tenure of office we find increasing references to education
               in the correspondence of New Brunswick's Lieutenant-Governors, references often
               characterized by shrewd observations, personal concern, and a sense of
               responsibility.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">Finally, in the Madras System, definite and distinctive methods of
               instruction were employed. This implied the training of teachers in those
                  methods,<note target="n4.185" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">185</hi>
               </note> accustomed people to the idea of teacher-training, and helped to pave the way
               for a Normal School. To combine efficiency and economy, and to enable one teacher to
               instruct many children, the older and brighter pupils acted as monitors, conducting a
               group of children, generally ten in number, to an assigned station in the classroom,
               where they taught lessons previously taught to them by the master. Thus the
               advantages in time and discipline of the class-system of instruction, mechanical
               though it was in this case, were demonstrated over the individual method with its
               waste of time and disorder, and the school became in a measure what Dr. Andrew Bell,
               one of the originators of the monitorial system, believed it should be, an organized
               community of mutually helpful members.<note target="n4.186" anchored="yes"

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">186</hi>
               </note> At best, this conception of the school was only imperfectly realized in the
               Madras Schools, and with the passing of the Madras System it received scant attention

            <p TEIform="p">The National Society, English sponsor of Madras Schools, was concerned
               principally with the education of the poor in the principles of the Established
               Church. In this country of few schools, people of all classes wished to patronize the
               schools, and so it became necessary, in the larger centres at any rate, to depart
               from the English precedent of confining instruction to the children of the indigent,
               as children <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">of the first

                  ten shillings, according to the ability of each individual to pay. The children of
                  Paupers, or of those who cannot afford to make any pecuniary compensation, will be
                  educated wholly at the expense of the institution.</q>

               not have been equal to the strain. Related to the first departure from English

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">190</hi>
               </note> There was still another. The Madras Schools were distinctly Church of England
               institutions, in fact, the aid such schools received from the National Society in
               England and from the S. P. G. practically necessitated their being so. But they
               provided such an inexpensive and superior type of education that Dissenters sent
               their children, who chorused with the class in Catechism the unhesitating, but in
               their case, the untrue statement that their godfathers and godmothers had given them
               their names at baptism.<note target="n4.191" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">191</hi>
               </note> Evidently the attendance of children of all denominations was encouraged, for
               a modification was made in the rule of church attendance. In 1819 E. J. Jarvis,
               Secretary of the National Board in Saint John, publicly denied reports circulating in
               the city and province that only children who attended the Anglican Church could
               receive certain merits, and that an exclusive preference was shown by the conductors
               of the National School to the worship of that church. He explained that a senior boy
               of each denomination having a house of worship in the city was appointed the Sunday
               Teacher of the boys of his persuasion, who went from the schoolroom under his
               direction to their own place of worship, and upon his report the master distributed
               the merits to all who thus attended.<note target="n4.192" anchored="yes"

               </note> As time went on, the difficulties of effecting the denominational purposes of
               the Madras Schools increased. The Thirtieth Report of the Madras Schools speaks of
               the difficulty of carrying out, in its integrity, the religious instruction
               contemplated, arising in some cases from want of proper books, in others from the
               objections of parents.<note target="n4.193" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </note> In connection with the latter, we may note that the occasion of the
               previously mentioned letter from Bishop Inglis to Sir Howard Douglas was the refusal
               of the trustees of a school at Chatham to apply for the provincial grant for the

               helped to create a sentiment in favor of education, supplying in a better manner than
               hitherto one of the crying needs of the country, namely, elementary education for
               children of all classes at small cost.<note target="n4.194" anchored="yes"

               </note> At the time of the founding of the Central School at Saint John (1818), the
               Secretary of the Society expressed the hope that these schools would effect an

               </note> Thirty years later the Society was still emphasizing the philanthropic and
               charitable purposes of the system and declaring that it had admirably answered these
                  ends.<note target="n4.196" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">196</hi>

               between children <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">of the first
                  respectability</q> and children of the pauper class, limited although such inter-

               breaking down of social barriers and in the democratizing of education.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">The discipline maintained in these schools was one of the features which
               helped to build up their reputation for efficiency. This discipline was inherent in
               the organization of the schools, but the use of various merits and demerits was also
               a factor. Joseph Lancaster, who had worked out the idea of monitorial instruction in
               England at about the same time as Dr. Bell did, had had as a dictum <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">let every child have for every minute of his
                  school time something to do and a motive for doing it.</q>

               </note> Since Pestalozzi's emphasis on child study and psychology was as yet little
               known outside of Switzerland and Germany, the possibility that such devices might
               occasionally operate harmfully on both the backward and the clever child was not
               recognized.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">In the early enthusiasm for Madras Schools, the mechanical nature of the
               instruction, with its emphasis on stereotyped memorized answers, was overlooked. From
               the first, however, the difficulty of obtaining teachers trained in the methods of
               the system was an obvious drawback. A few were trained at Halifax. Others underwent a
               course of instruction at the central training school, i.e., the Central School at
               Saint John, but the majority had only a short course in one of the branch schools,
               thereby experiencing only a limited opportunity of obtaining a really adequate
               knowledge of the system. A correspondent, writing in the Saint John Gazette in
                  1822,<note target="n4.199" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">199</hi>
               </note> said that visits he had made to the greater number of the so-called Madras
               Schools of the province had forced on him the conclusion that many were such in name
               only, and he singled out the school at Sussex Vale, conducted by Anthony Truro, as an
                  exception.<note target="n4.200" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">200</hi>
               </note> Time apparently did not lessen this difficulty, for the Thirtieth Report of
               the Society, already referred to, mentions as one of the peculiar difficulties in
               this country of carrying out the Madras plan that of obtaining masters versed in the
               system and friendly to its operation, and admits a further difficulty in retaining
               efficient monitors, because parents objected to their children's exercise of the
               office of teacher, and were often induced to withdraw them from school at an early
               age in order to place them at trades.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">In spite of the defects and difficulties which have been cited, Madras
               Schools enjoyed great popularity for a long time. They were established in rural
               areas as well as in towns and cities; the Legislature gave annual grants;<note

               Schools until the close of the period under consideration there were several
               legislative acts dealing with education, but no significant developments. In 1823 an
               amendment to the Grammar School Act of 1816 increased the provincial grant to £ 175
               per school, and repeated the provision which stipulated that the county must raise
               the sum of £ 100 before any sum could be obtained from the provincial treasury. This
               last was done on the grounds that the said requisition tended more to defeat the
               object of the Legislature than to encourage the establishment of schools as was
                  intended.<note target="n4.204" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </note> a measure in the interests of simplicity and uniformity, and one possibly
               necessitated by the illiteracy of the Justices themselves, for Peter Fisher, New
               Brunswick's first historian, commenting in 1825 on the lack of educational
               opportunities during the early years, admitted that <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">from this cause many persons who occasionally

            <p TEIform="p">The endowment of the college as King's College in 1829 focused attention
               on the Grammar Schools as the natural feeders of the college. A Committee of the
               Assembly, appointed to examine the state of education in the province, commended only
               the Parish Schools, reporting that the Madras Schools in rural areas were failures,
               and that the Grammar Schools were not doing the work expected. The Grammar School Act
               which followed had, however, no really remedial features. Arrangements relating to
               the licensing of teachers, the course of study, tuition fees, and the trustees and
               their duties, were practically identical with those provided for by the Act of 1816.
               In an effort to make the people themselves take greater responsibility for their
               schools the provincial grant was cut to £ 100, and no Grammar School could be in
               receipt of this sum unless the inhabitants of the county had raised the sum of £ 50
               in support of the master. Lest a master, intent on obtaining the provincial grant,
               should consider it a good investment to pay part of this fifty pounds himself, the
               Act expressly prohibited him from doing so. The most interesting feature of the Act
               of 1829 was the clause which stated that after the first of June, 1830, no clergyman
               of any denomination, having the spiritual charge of any parish or congregation, could
               be appointed master or usher of a Grammar School.<note target="n4.208" anchored="yes"
                  TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">208</hi>
               </note> While all clergymen were thus prohibited from combining teaching and
               preaching, this restriction really struck at the Church of England, and was part of a
               growing assault on the privileges of that church.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">We may note a few of the points of this assault. In line with the recent
                  <pb n="71" id="p71" TEIform="pb"/> emancipation in Britain of Dissenters from
               certain political disabilities, the province passed a Catholic Emancipation Act in
               1830, in spite of opposition in the Council on the part of a Tory of the old school,
               Chief Justice Saunders.<note target="n4.209" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">209</hi>
               </note> The old privilege of benefit of clergy was abolished in the same year,
               following similar action in Britain in 1829.<note target="n4.210" anchored="yes"
                  TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">210</hi>
               </note> The Dissenters' Marriage Bill, which had been repeatedly blocked by the
               Council, was again to the fore, petitions coming in from every part of the province.
               When the measure finally passed in 1832 it was suspended in Britain on the grounds
               that it was not liberal enough, and had to be redrafted before going into operation
               in 1834.<note target="n4.211" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">211</hi>
               </note> The new college charter of 1829 allowed Dissenters to attend the college and
               to take degrees, although the influence of the Church of England in the College
               Council was still impregnable. Thus, slowly, here and there, the Church of England,
               one of the pillars of society, if society were to be good according to Anglican-Tory
               standards, had to give ground before new forces, new ideas, and the growing numbers
               of other denominations. The Act of 1833 relating to Parish Schools was the last in a
               series which resulted in the development of a school system with a minimum of
               administrative machinery.<note target="n4.212" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">212</hi>
               </note> The Act differed very little in essentials from that of 1816 except that it
               lacked the assessment clause. This time the number of Trustees was definitely set at
               three, but they still presided over the whole parish, which they were now required to
               divide into school districts.<note target="n4.213" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">213</hi>
               </note> The schools were to be financed in much the same way as before. When a school
               had been kept to the satisfaction of the Trustees for not less than six months, the
               Trustees certified the facts to the Justices, these officers in turn made certificate
               to the Lt.-Gov ernor, and the legislative grant&#8212;at the rate of £ 20 per school for
               one year was issued, provided that no parish received more than £ 160 a year, and no
               county a larger sum than would amount to an average of £ 120 for each parish in the
                  county.<note target="n4.214" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">214</hi>
               </note> This last provision may have been designed to prevent the laying off of small
               and unnecessary school districts.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">Perhaps the most interesting feature of this Act were the references to
               female teachers. Only two female teachers could receive a grant. in any one parish,
               and this grant was only one-half of that issued to males. Moreover, the inhabitants
               were not required to pay female teachers more than one-half of what they must pay
               masters. In other words, the total salary of a female teacher would not amount to
               more than £ 20 for the whole year. Fitch, in commenting on these restrictions, says
               that teachers taught the things they knew, and that the female teachers of the time
               did not know enough.<note target="n4.215" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

            <p TEIform="p">Fifty years of provincial life had now passed for New Brunswick, and ten
               different measures dealing with education had been enacted, yet there was no central
               educational authority, no provision for the training of teachers, and no <pb n="72"
                  id="p72" TEIform="pb"/> adequate system of inspection. The trustees, appointed by
               the Justices for one year, were, in the last analysis, the only officers with
               authority. Although unpaid, they were supposed to visit all the schools of their
               parish twice a year, a duty impossible of performance considering the nature of the
               roads. The teachers untrained, poorly paid, and subject to the vicissitudes of <q

               remained in a district more than six months.<note target="n4.216" anchored="yes"

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">216</hi>
               </note> The time had evidently come for drastic changes in educational administration
               and policy. Change was in the air, was already altering society. Tory bureaucrats had
               used the Established Church, tradition, monopoly of education, of culture and of
               politics, to mark off neat and clear divisions in a simple social pattern. Now, with
               little regard for the old rules, new people, new forces, new interests, were at the
               loom and were casually making a tangled, inartistic, kaleidoscopic design.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">It began with the rise to prominence of the lumber trade, and the influx
               of immigrants at the end of the Napoleonic Wars, developments so enthusiastically
               hailed as prophetic of a new era of prosperity that their disruptive potentialities
               were not recognized.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">Disturbing repercussions from the lumber trade could be more marked in
               New Brunswick than elsewhere because there was no clear division between the natural
               forest and farm lands, as in Upper and Lower Canada. The fertile soil of the Saint
               John and the Miramichi river valleys sloped to rocky ledges of splendid stands of
               pine, <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">and thus, just as lumbering
                  overshadowed agriculture throughout the province as a whole, so it crowded farming
                  even on the lands of the individual settler</q>, dividing the population into two
               groups. One group, that of the camps and shipyards, was composed of the lumberers and
               labourers; the other comprised the farmer-lumbermen who tried to combine two
               occupations to the disadvantage of both.<note target="n4.217" anchored="yes"

                  the settlers in the New Brunswick forests. Their neglect of their farms ended
                  either in abandonment or in extremely slovenly farming</q>. Food for home
               consumption, such as flour and salt pork, had to be imported in great quantities. <q

                  exports, while food from the United States had to be paid for mainly in cash. Many
                  and bitter were the local indictments of an industry which sapped the energies of
                  a bold 'peasantry' and kept the Province dependent for its very food on a foreign

               for a long time. This meant that when Britain abandoned her policy of preferential

            <p TEIform="p">In the Tory conception of an ideal society, landed proprietors,
               officials, and professional men gave paternalistic leadership to respectful and
               pliant farmers, tradesmen, and laborers. With the growth of the lumber industry,
               lumbermen of all grades from the merchant-speculator down to the lumberjack of the
               camps became a new and disturbing element in society, one that failed to fit into the
               old picture. The merchants <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">steadily

                  coureurs-de-bois of the nineteenth century; and they swaggered about the streets
                  of Saint John with the same jaunty and insolent assurance that the returned fur
                  traders had once showed in Montreal . . . Like the coureurs-de-bois, whom they so

               rum was not, of course, new. In 1786 the province had imported from the West Indies

            <p TEIform="p">Increasingly, after the 1820's, the immigrant also became an obtrusive
               figure. He did not come unsolicited, as we have seen. Unfortunately, the majority of
               those who came were famine-poor Irish, unfitted for pioneer farming and unskilled in
               the trades. There were some Scotch, mostly dispossessed crofters, but among them,
               apparently, no individual of the stature of Thomas McCulloch, whose passion for
               education made Pictou Academy in the neighboring province a powerful educational
               influence. One explanation of the fact that the most desirable immigrants did not
               come to New Brunswick, or coming, did not remain, lies in the more rapid expansion of
               the United States, which made that country the Mecca of the majority of those who
               crossed the Atlantic. But passage to New Brunswick was cheaper than to the United
               States because of the returning empty lumber-boats, and because there were no
               regulations to prevent captains from crowding their vessels with immigrants and
               dumping them at the ports of New Brunswick without any further responsibility. Once
               here, the ablest slipped over the border to the United States, leaving the indigent,
               the idle, and the helpless to burden this province.<note target="n4.230"

               John, where the problem was particularly acute, a number of meetings<note

               largely left to philanthropists and harassed communities to wrestle with as best they
               might, receiving no very adequate attention from either the British or Provincial
               authorities. In 1834 a Saint John resident, in an article entitled <q rend="inline"

                  question, and it is with difficulty that they can be persuaded to go into the

               </note> Enough has been said to show that the first decades of European immigration
               created many problems in New Brunswick and did not materially better the agricultural
               situation. Many of the able-bodied among the newcomers did, of course, work in the
               lumber camps and in the shipyards of Saint John, but this work, being dependent on
               the fluctuations of lumber and ships in the British market, meant an uncertain
               living.</p>

               numbers and extent. Content with a minimum of material comforts, absorbed in family
               life, devoted to their Church, these people lived apart, and as yet exerted but
               little influence on the political life of the Province.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">For the most part all these new groups in society were not characterized
               by literacy, and were not anxious for the benefits of education. They constituted, as
               it were, a second frontier society. Social considerations, as Professor Clark points
               out, have little weight in frontier society, and behaviour tends to be the expression
               of immediately felt wants.<note target="n4.238" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">238</hi>
               </note> Because of the early emphasis on education for the ruling classes, and
               because of public indifference, partly engendered by lack of acquaintance with
               schooling, the educational facilities of the province were not adequate to take care
               of the growing population. To the majority of people in the groups we have been
               considering, the material struggle with environment left neither time nor money for
               community services. Those possessing capital were bent on economic exploitation,
               particularly those in the lumber business. This exploitive process was in full swing
               when Peter Fisher wrote his <hi rend="italic" TEIform="hi">First History</hi>, and
               drew from him some trenchant remarks on the lack of public spirit. In speaking of the
               lack of ornamentation in the city of Saint John, he said that men of independent
               property, and those holding office in the different departments, were too few to do
               much, and many of the <pb n="76" id="p76" TEIform="pb"/> merchants in the shipping
               business were transients, who aimed to make as much as they could in as short a time
               as possible before returning to enjoy their gains in their native country. <q

                  rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">A stranger would naturally suppose
                  that such a trade must produce great riches to the country; and that great and
                  rapid improvements would be made . . . . But here he would not only be
                  disappointed but astonished at the rugged and uncouth appearance of most part of
                  this extensive country . . . . The persons principally engaged in shipping the
                  timber have been strangers who have taken no interest in the welfare of the
                  country; but have merely occupied a spot to make what they could in the shortest
                  possible time . . . . The forests are stripped and nothing is left in prospect but
                  the gloomy apprehension when the timber is gone of sinking into insignificance and
                  poverty.</q> Continuing, he said that the woods used to swarm with American
               adventurers who cut as they pleased, felling only the prime trees, manufacturing only
               the best of what they had felled, and leaving the tops to rot. Now there was a system

               and so, <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">men who take no interest in

               </note> Our glance at conditions in New Brunswick in the first half of the nineteenth
               century has shown that much in both the old and the new strata of society operated
               against the extension of education, and that it would take a long time to inculcate
               the bulk of the people with a regard for the value of schools, and a willingness to
               pay for them. On the other hand, in a conservative province where change came slowly,
               anything so drastic as compulsion was bound to be repellent. Moreover, in the decades
               which were coming up, there were political as well as economic questions to be
               resolved which would monopolize the stage at the expense of energetic educational
               policy.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">As we have seen, there had been, from the first, intermittent clashes
               between the Council and Assembly, but now the question of executive responsibility to
               the people was about to become an issue, and even in this most loyal province there
               were signs of dissatisfaction with certain features of imperial policy. Already
               (1833), New Brunswick, the first province to make the <pb n="77" id="p77"
                  TEIform="pb"/> change, had obtained a division of the executive and legislative
               functions of the Council, and was demanding control of the Crown lands and provincial
               revenue in return for a fixed Civil list.<note target="n4.244" anchored="yes"

            <p TEIform="p">In Britain herself parliament had just been reformed, and middle class
               liberalism, with its emphasis on laissez-faire principles, its antagonism to
               governmental restrictions on trade, and its new attitudes towards colonies, was
               growing. In France, Louis Philippe's bourgeois government had just been established,
               and in the United States Jacksonian democracy had recently triumphed over the old
               political aristocracy. In Upper and Lower Canada, political grievances were mounting
               and would soon burst out in the Rebellion of 1837, and in Nova Scotia Joseph Howe was
               emerging as an able advocate of self-government. Echoes of all this from near and far
               reached New Brunswick, but perhaps served less to inflame sentiment than to emphasize
               the moderate language and respectful behaviour of those who here opposed the old
               order. Yet coincident with the social changes already described there was a new note

               for the Governor's use he complained of the inconvenience and embarrassment to which
               he was exposed in travelling between Saint John and Fredericton, when shut up for a

               when he set out for North America, that he was bound for a land where the rights of a

            <p TEIform="p">Dislike of Tory practices, principles, and institutions was perhaps not
               often expressed with the irreverence and the venom employed by A Manchester Turn-out,
               nevertheless with the growth of immigration and the development of the lumber
               business the fact was increasingly apparent that there were in the province large
               numbers of people who knew not the old concepts, or were, for social, mercantile,
               political or religious reasons, definitely hostile to them. These attitudes hampered
               the maintenance of a privileged church, a favored class, a political oligarchy, and
               an exclusive college. Professor Creighton has described the situation as one which
               presented increasing difficulties to those Loyalist leaders who wished to impose
               their ideal of a good society on New Brunswick, and in reference to the Church of
               England, the schools of the S. P. G., and King's College, he writes: <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">These treasured institutions, these unquestioned
                  cultural standards, were threatened in the strange and rather precarious world

            <head TEIform="head"> CHAPTER 5. <lb/>PROVINCIAL SOCIETY IN TRANSITION</head>

            <p TEIform="p">The instinctive purpose of the leading Loyalists of New Brunswick to
               establish a society based on loyalty and permanency of British connection, and
               characterized by paternalistic government, class distinctions, and traditional lines
               of behaviour, formed an easily recognizable motif for the first fifty years of New
               Brunswick history, and the subordinating influences of that purpose stood out with a
               large degree of clarity. A central theme for the next two decades is less easy to
               perceive.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">While the province had emerged as a whole from the frontier-stage,
               society continued to exhibit locally certain frontier characteristics, such as
               intemperance, rowdyism, and illiteracy. These manifestations of a lack of adjustment
               to new conditions were not abated by the increased tempo of immigration, particularly
               after the Irish famine of 1845, nor by the injudicious speculation, followed by
               periods of depression, which, as before, accompanied a persistent reliance on lumber
               as a staple industry.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">During this period the province experienced a number of disasters,
               including a typhus epidemic in 1847 in which Saint John, as the port of entry for the
               majority of the immigrants, suffered particularly; an outbreak of Asiatic cholera in
               1854; and severe fires in the city of Saint John in 1837, 1839, and 1841. Adverse
               weather conditions led to serious crop-failures in 1836 and 1845, and, in general,
               the status of agriculture continued to be rather depressed for the same reasons that
               had obtained earlier. There was, however, increased emphasis on the agricultural
               possibilities of the province by lecturers, editors, legislators, and governors.
               Lt.-Governor Sir John Harvey, in a letter to Lord John Russell in 1840, said that he
               had urged, and would continue to urge, on the people of New Brunswick a steady
               attention to agriculture in preference to lumbering pursuits, and expressed the
               opinion that the farmers of New Brunswick had only to adopt an improved system of
               agriculture in order to insure the fulfilment of every reasonable expectation.<note

               </note> As an example of gubernatorial concern over the unfitness of the majority of
               the Irish immigrants for farming, we may note that Lt.-Governor Colebrooke wrote in
               1842: <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">In regarding the colonies as
                  a refuge for the indigent classes it is manifest that so arduous a mode of
                  life</q>, (as farming), <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">requires
                  that their previous habits and experience should in some degree have prepared them
                  to encounter its trials, model colonies at home might thus be made a means of
                  training for Emigration to the settlements abroad and if the habits of self
                  dependence should thus be acquired and skill in the rude arts in which, the
                  American settlers excel their difficulties would be abridged and their success
                  more effectually assured.</q>

               </note> Incidentally, Cole- <pb n="80" id="p80" TEIform="pb"/> brooke's concern may
               have been sharpened by clashes between the Irish and Orangemen. In reporting such
               episodes at Fredericton, Saint John, and Woodstock in 1847, Colebrooke stressed the
               importance <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">of guarding against the
                  adoption of any public measures which would have the effect at this time of
                  promoting an extensive emigration from Ireland, without a corresponding increase
                  of population from other parts of the United Kingdom</q>.<note target="n5.3"

               </note> Among the public speakers and newspaper men who were vocal on the subject of
               agriculture we note the Rev. W. T. Wishart, who gave a number of lectures before the
               Mechanics Institute of Saint John. Speaking in the hall of that body in 1845,
               Wishart, after showing how the agriculture of Scotland had been raised from a
               deplorable condition to a high state of efficiency by means of agricultural societies
               and meetings, the publication of useful practical works, the institution of a
               professorship of agriculture, the importation of seeds and plants, and the
               application of chemistry to an investigation of soils and manures, asked why might
               this not be done in New Brunswick. He declared that in a few years the province would
               be stripped of its timber, and that our legislators should be devising means by which
               new resources might be ready to supply the failure of lumber as a staple
                  product.<note target="n5.4" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">4</hi>
               </note> The same note was sounded by the editor of the New Brunswick Courier at a
               time when the end of the old navigation system had given rise to a feeling that
               Britain had deserted her colonies, and that the timber trade of the province would be
               ruined, The editorial in question commented favorably on the action just taken by
               the legislature in employing Professor Johnston to ascertain the agricultural
               capabilities of the province, but declared that something must be done to carry out
               Professor Johnston's views, and suggested that the science of agriculture might be
               introduced into our schools, especially in the country, and that Model Farms, which
               had proved of advantage in other parts of the world, might be established in New
                  Brunswick.<note target="n5.5" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">5</hi>
               </note> The scientist referred to, Professor J. F. W. Johnston, F.R.S., bore witness
               in his report that in New Brunswick a more general feeling appeared to prevail on the
               subject of agriculture among all educated persons than he had met anywhere else.<note
                  target="n5.6" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">6</hi>
               </note> Professor Johnston's report was a valuable document, although over-optimistic
               about the agricultural possibilities of the province. It is interesting to note that
               the year in which it was presented in the legislature the subject of converting
               King's College into an agricultural school, with a model farm attached, came up for
               discussion in the Assembly for the first time.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">Carried over from an earlier day were other problems and concerns besides
               those to which brief reference has just been made. Among such was the question of the
               Maine boundary which vexed a good part of the governorship of Sir John Harvey, and
               was not settled until 1842 by the Ashburton Treaty. Another was a legacy of the
               imperial connection. We saw earlier that during the Napoleonic Wars the mercantile
               system of the Empire had become <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q"
                  >heavily <pb n="81" id="p81" TEIform="pb"/> weighted in favour of the colonies</q>
               <note target="n5.7" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">7</hi>
               </note> through differential duties. Under the stimulus of the tariff favoring
               colonial wood, New Brunswick had built up a large trade with the United Kingdom in
               timber. The rise of a new manufacturing class in England and the trade depression
               which followed the Napoleonic Wars increased the numbers of those who championed
               freer trade. In 1821 there was a minor reduction of colonial protection. Others
               followed, and in 1849 preferential duties were abolished, and the ships of all
               nations might carry what they would from colonial ports. <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">All these drastic changes ended the old colonial
                  system. It is hardly putting it too strongly to say that as they virtually all
                  proceeded from English attention to English interests, . . . they constituted an
                  attitude on the part of England to break away from her own empire.</q>
               <note target="n5.8" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">8</hi>
               </note> Naturally, the colonies bitterly opposed these changes, and in New Brunswick
               the lumber trade and the prosperity of the province seemed to face disaster, although
               possibly the correspondent, who signed the name Paul Jones to an article in the
               Courier in 1850, saw compensations in the abolition of the lumber preference. The
               article in question was in the form of a dialogue between Mr. Sharpe and Squire, in
               which the former set forth his opinion that the results of lumbering were disastrous
               to the welfare of New Brunswick. <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">It
                  is a business, Squire, which is based on the most fictitious credit . . . Its
                  foundation is cram and credit, the very worst two words in the English language
                  for a new country.</q> The workmen were paid in goods and did not know until they
               settled what price was charged. Often when they settled they were in debt. It was
               bad, too, for agriculture. When the men should be on the land they were log-driving
               until the last of June. The crops, put in too late, were poor. Then the farmers
               cursed the country and said it would produce nothing.<note target="n5.9"

               </note> The Governor also wrote to Grey in 1850: <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">Your Lordship must not suppose that I myself or
                  that the most intelligent men in New Brunswick look on the stimulus afforded to
                  lumbering by the old protective duties as wholesome in itself, even if it were
                  practicable to continue it. The habits of reckless speculation, and the preference
                  of a wasteful and wandering mode of life to the quiet monotony of agriculture, are
                  among the evils which the protective system has implanted in the province.</q>

               with an outlet for their produce which might in some measure compensate them for that
               which they had lost; and even declared that if England did not so interfere the

               ferment of the forties and early fifties, and influenced, either positively or
               negatively, the other important issues of the period.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">One aspect of the high degree of industrialization which had been taking
               place in England and in certain parts of the United States was progress in railroad
               construction. New Brunswick was not highly industrialized, although if we may believe
               an editorial in the Saint John Chronicle in 1837, there was considerable enterprise.

                  business . . . . No capital is here permitted to sleep, and the impetus that is

               </note> These circumstances may have helped to prompt the above expression of pride
               and confidence. We can make some allowance, too, for the note of complacency, by
               remembering that in 1837 New Brunswick, by contrast with Upper and Lower Canada,
               seemed a model province, <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">the
                  brightest pearl in the chaplet of British American provinces</q>,<note

               </note> and fulsome self-praise was therefore in order. Unfortunately, the capital
               referred to was limited, and the business enterprises were on a small scale. Several
               of Lt.-Gov. Colebrooke's dispatches refer to this lack of capital and to the
               hampering effects of such limitations. In 1841, after making a circuit through the
               remote counties of New Brunswick, Colebrooke wrote: <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">The extent to which progress of the Americans has
                  been accelerated by means of British capital obtained through the public credit is
                  contrasted with the little encouragement in this way which the British Provinces
                  have derived since the revolution; and the obvious inadequacy of their own means
                  to the object, and their relative weakness compared with the neighboring states,
                  have led the colonists to feel that the time has arrived when the realization of
                  the advantages from British connection ought not to be longer delayed.</q>

                  produce, while in New Brunswick it is remarkable that with the exceptions of the
                  encouragement given for the erection of mills for sawed lumber and some grist
                  mills there has been scarcely an attempt made to establish any kind of manufacture

               </note> It would seem, therefore, that the early interest in railways in New
               Brunswick was not a direct result of the Industrial Revolution, but was an indication
               that the isolation of the province was breaking down, the continental pull was making
               itself felt, and a belief was beginning to prevail, especially after 1850, that
               prosperity depended on having the province fit into a progressive North American
               scheme of things.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">In contrast with the isolation and insulation of the foundation years
               there was indeed a widening range of interests, influences, and contacts. The
               struggle for Responsible Government helped to broaden horizons, for it directed
               attention to those British provinces which had experienced, or were experiencing, a
               similar struggle&#8212;the Canadas and Nova Scotia; and from the latter province came

               </note> Instead of the early antagonism against the United States there was now often
               open admiration of American municipal and educational institutions, and a tendency to
               refer to them as examples. In 1852 a New Brunswick legislator could quote Horace Mann
               and was able to describe the schools, not only of Toronto, but also of Boston. In the
               technical, cultural, and educational extremity of the province, men of science <pb
                  n="84" id="p84" TEIform="pb"/> and learning were brought in to make reports, or to
               lay new foundations. We have already mentioned Professor Johnston. From 1838 to 1842
               Abraham Gesner was engaged in making a geological survey of the province. Engineers,
               engaged to make surveys for the proposed railways, contributed to the technical
               knowledge of the colony. From Scotland came James Robb, a man of science, culture,
               and experience in travel, to serve as professor at King's College from 1837 to 1861.
               When at last Governor Colebrooke's cherished scheme of a Training School for teachers
               came to tardy fruition, Marshall d'Avray, a polished and cosmopolitan gentleman, was
               imported from England to be the first master, and remained in the province in various
               educational capacities until the day of his death. In 1854, Upper Canada and Nova
               Scotia lent Egerton Ryerson and William Dawson respectively, to act as members of a
               commission investigating King's College and New Brunswick education. These men, as
               Superintendents of Education in their respective provinces, had studied the best
               educational systems of the United States, and Ryerson had also visited Germany. Dr.
               J. C. Webster has said <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">Those whose
                  vision never pierces beyond the confines of their own land are utterly unable to
                  form an estimate of their own development, because they are lacking in standards
                  of comparison</q>.<note target="n5.25" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">25</hi>
               </note> By the middle of the nineteenth century, however, there was no excuse for the
               leading men of New Brunswick to plead ignorance of what other countries were doing in
               education. Even second-hand glimpses of what lay beyond the province could not fail
               to stir a spirit of reform. We find, therefore, that at the close of this period the
               most intelligent men of New Brunswick were quick to extol science, to give lip
               service at least to the idea of education for all, and to rejoice that they lived in
               an age of progress. Over against this, however, was the great weight of indifference
               which characterized a large proportion of the population. To the definitely poor, and
               there were many such, education seemed too much of a luxury to be considered at all.
               Others, in better economic circumstances thought of progress in terms of material
               gain, were skeptical of the value of a better education than they themselves had had,
               as a means of <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">getting on</q>, and
               strongly opposed any change which would mean a greater expenditure for schools. The
               existence of such attitudes meant that the most active of educational reformers in
               New Brunswick could, like Lincoln, <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q"

            <p TEIform="p">This survey of conditions in New Brunswick between the years 1833 and
               1854 has showed a province harassed by many serious problems, and stirred by a number
               of exciting possibilities, a province subjected to a number of old, and many new,
               forces from within and from without, a province reluctant to leave the past but not
               entirely content to remain in it. All this meant at least ferment, if not ebullience,
               a ferment which may be considered the motif of the period.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">The characteristic spirit in which the major problems of these decades
               were faced kept the ferment below the pitch of ebullience, yet, paradoxically, <pb
                  n="85" id="p85" TEIform="pb"/> added to it. When the pudding does not boil
               furiously, it must simmer longer in the pot. Responsible Government, a Training
               School for teachers, the reform of King's College, the adoption of the assessment
               principle, were questions which for years agitated, but did not convulse, the
               province. A people to whom cataclysm is unnatural will hail compromises,
               half-measures, and petty improvements as lengthy strides in the march of progress,
               and thus will postpone the improvement of conditions which require remedy.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">The temper of the province during these decades exhibited an empirical
               strain in that there seemed to be an absence of clear philosophy, an inconsistency in
               attitudes and alignments, a failure to understand the true meaning of abstract
               principles, and a tendency to interpret such principles in terms of some practical
               effect on individuals, institutions, and practices.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">Several writers, thinking about New Brunswick trends, have commented on
               various aspects of this trait. Professor A. G. Bailey, referring to the rugged
               individualism of New Brunswick's political and industrial leaders during the
               pre-Confederation period, has noted that the effect of the small-scale enterprise of
               the province and its geographical segregation induced a <q rend="inline"

               </note> Hannay has remarked that New Brunswick has always been slow to make
               constitutional changes, even when such changes were based on sound principles, and
               adds: <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">There has often been a great
                  disposition on the part of our people to judge the merits of a question rather by

                  rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">One cannot but be struck with the
                  difference in the aims which the people of New Brunswick set before themselves, as
                  compared with those sought in other provinces. While they were struggling to widen
                  the sphere of self-government, New Brunswick confined itself to strictly practical
                  objectives. The people instinctively accepted Pope's dictum, 'for forms of
                  government let fools contest', and were quite satisfied with a government which
                  administered their affairs as they wished, let its form be what it might. If a
                  constitutional principle was cited, it was simply to reinforce a plea advanced on
                  other grounds for some object they desired to obtain</q>.<note target="n5.30"

               </note>
            </p>

            <p TEIform="p">While we need not concern ourselves here with the details of the
               development of responsible government, it is well to keep in mind that there was a
               definite connection between political and educational developments in New Brunswick.
               For one thing, political questions, appearing more alluring and exciting than other
               developments, tended to occupy the centre of the stage and to leave only a modicum of
               time, interest, energy, and thought for educational problems. The most intelligent
               and liberal-minded men of the province were <pb n="86" id="p86" TEIform="pb"/>
               absorbed in the political struggle. While L. A. Wilmot served on education committees
               time after time in the eighteen-forties, his position as one of the leaders for
               political reforms demanded his best talents and much of his time. The same might be
               said of Charles Fisher. Moreover, with so many important constitutional issues
               hanging in the balance, even the most personally unselfish legislators hesitated to
               push unpopular questions, such as assessment for schools, lest they jeopardize, not
               only their own political careers, but also the cause of political reform. This
               negative effect of politics on education was perhaps more marked in New Brunswick
               than in the other British North American provinces, because here the achievement of
               full responsible government was such a long drawn-out process of fits and starts,
               retrogressions, delays, and half-measures.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">There was still another link between politics and schools. Either because
               members of the Assembly failed to understand the real meaning of responsible
               government, or understanding it, preferred a partial application of the system to
               losing certain personal advantages, the majority of the House opposed transferring
               from the Assembly to the Executive the right to initiate money votes, even though the
               Executive of this period differed a good deal from the old Executives with which
               early Assemblies had clashed so frequently. According to the time-worn procedure, any
               member of the Assembly could propose on the floors of the House a grant for a

               </note> That this was an inefficient method of doing business was proved when the
               sizable fortune, which had accrued to the province on Britain's surrender in 1837 of
               the casual and territorial revenue, was squandered in five years. Yet in 1842, when
               the province was heavily in debt, a resolution passed in the Assembly that it was
               inexpedient to alter the existing mode of appropriation, which, tested as it was by
               fifty years of exper ience, gave satisfaction to the people of the province.<note

               </note> In spite, however, of the obvious defects of the system, and in spite of
               plain-speaking on the matter on the part of Lt.-Governors Colebrooke and Head, the
               Assembly, as a whole, continued to resent any suggestions for change that were put
               forward by the more liberal members. Outside the Assembly in 1849, but soon to be an
               important political figure, S. L. Tilley denounced the extravagance and inefficiency
               of the old way in an indictment which made particular reference to the schools of the
               province. Tilley, the Chairman of a special committee of the New Brunswick Colonial
               Association, in presenting a report of the committee recommending economy in
               provincial expenditures and a reduction in the salaries of public functionaries,
               scored the existing system of initiating money grants as corrupt, and declared that
               the school system was not only inefficient but discreditable to <pb n="87" id="p87"
                  TEIform="pb"/> the province. He suggested that the schools of the Eastern States
               should be studied, and a competent person engaged to organize a corresponding system
               in New Brunswick, and stated that <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q"
                  >it would be impossible to find in the history of any country a precedent for such
                  a system of jobbing, gross corruption, electioneering and bribery, as our
                  Legislators have introduced into their mode of making School and Bye-road
                  appropriations</q>.<note target="n5.34" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">34</hi>
               </note> Tilley, it is true, was in opposition to the government of the day, but there
               is evidence arising from other sources that he did not greatly exaggerate.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">If the peculiarities of the New Brunswick temperament had influenced only
               political developments during this period, there would be little reason to emphasize
               those peculiarities as we have done. It is illogical, however, to suppose that a
               people who approached serious political issues without a clear conception of the
               principles involved would think very deeply in educational matters, or would care to
               look very far ahead. That educational reforms proceeded in the same halting and
               rather desultory fashion as political reforms will emerge later from a detailed study
               of educational measures, but to suggest at this point that educational developments
               in this period had little enough of clear policy back of them, and were generally of
               a last-minute stopgap nature will help us to distinguish these characteristics later,
               in the midst of a vast assortment of heterogeneous facts.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">Some of the hesitation in effecting political and educational changes
               came, of course, from that other prominent New Brunswick trait conservatism. This
               quality, a legacy of the circumstances under which the province had been founded in
               1784, had become deeply rooted during the long period of rule by the Family Compact.
               Expressions of pride in the loyalty and good-behaviour of the province, such as would
               have disgusted <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">A Manchester
                  Turnout</q>
               <note target="n5.35" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">35</hi>
               </note> were current coin in the language of the press, the lecture hall, the
               assembly room, and the official dispatch. As we have seen, the ultra-Tories had been
               careful to identify innovation with disloyalty, but even those who were aware that
               change might sometimes be the practical expression of a high type of patriotism
               repudiated any methods of effecting reforms which might be considered
               unconstitutional, and not infrequently, when suggesting that the province might
               profit from the study of American municipal or educational institutions, hastened to
               declare a prejudice against a Republican form of Government, lest their loyalty be
               doubted. When, in 1850, the editor of the New Brunswick Courier stated that <q
                  rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">the people of New Brunswick have
                  always chosen to do their political work in the legal and prescribed manner</q>,
               he implied that this was so because they were <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified"
                  TEIform="q">quiet and conservative by nature and education</q>.<note
                  target="n5.36" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">36</hi>
               </note> Inevitably, anything coercive, such as compulsory school assessment or
               insistence on the attendance of all teachers at a training school, seemed drastic to
               people of this temperament. The whole course of the struggle for responsible
               government reveals the fact, that, while they might be unpredictable in their
               reactions to the details</p>



            <pb n="88" id="p88" TEIform="pb"/>

            <p TEIform="p">of a question, they were invariably cautious and deliberate in making a
               great decision. So it was in education. Projects for improvement evolved by slow
               degrees, and the more rapid progress of other countries often failed to present a
               challenge, being quietly dismissed as unsuitable to New Brunswick conditions.
               Nevertheless, in these crowded years, these fermenting forties and fifties, a
               conservative people, prone to be more concerned with practical details than with
               profound philosophies, did move forward considerably in educational theory and
               practice. The separate steps in this adjustment to changing times and conditions must
               now claim our attention.</p>

            <head TEIform="head">CHAPTER 6. <lb/>EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS 1833-1847</head>


            <p TEIform="p">We saw that in 1833 machinery in New Brunswick for the administration of
               education was of the simplest kind. There was no central educational authority,
               nothing corresponding to a board of education or a superintendent of education. There
               were no qualified inspectors; in fact there was scarcely any effective inspection at
               all, since the parish trustees, on whom the responsibility rested, either neglected
               their duty or performed it in a perfunctory manner. Licenses to teach were issued by
               the Lieutenant-Governor on simple conditions, without examination, to untrained
               applicants, who all too often were individuals who had failed at other occupations
               because of certain habits or limitations.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">In 1854 this picture of negations was no longer true. A Board of
               Education, a Normal School, a Superintendent of Education, and a system of inspection
               had all been established by legal enactments and were functioning, after a fashion at
               least. Even assessment as a means of supporting schools had regained on the statute
               books that place as a permissive measure prematurely won in 1816, and lost in 1818.
               These achievements were crowded into the last seven years of the period, but one
               cannot call the interval from 1833 to 1847 completely barren, for the School Act of
               1837 paved the way for the establishment ten years later of a central authority, and
               the special inspection of 1844 of all schools in the province, by exposing the truth
               about school buildings, teachers, texts, and school attendance, emphasized the urgent
               need of improvement, and may be regarded as a preliminary to the reform measures
               which followed.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">The Act of 1837 differed from the Act of 1833 in only a few of its
               provisions. One pertained to female teachers. There was now to be no distinction
               between a grant issued to a female teacher and one issued to a male, but not more
               than three schools in a parish, if taught by females, could be included in the
               schedule of trustees' certificates submitted semi-annually to the Lieutenant-Governor
               by the Justices of the County. <note target="n6.1" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">1</hi>
               </note> This meant that female teachers in excess of three to a parish were deprived
               of their government grant, unless they petitioned the legislature for a special
               dispensation in their favor. A perusal of the Journals of the Assembly for the next
               ten years informs us that many teachers petitioned the House for these reasons, or
               because the Trustees had been careless and failed to certify the school, or because
               the school happened to be in excess of the total number which in any given parish or
               county could legally receive the provincial allowance. To reduce the number of
               petitions arising from the reason last mentioned, an amendment in 1840 increased the
               maximum allowance to each parish and county, therefore increasing the number <pb
                  n="90" id="p90" TEIform="pb"/> of provincially supported schools.<note
                  target="n6.2" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">2</hi>
               </note>
            </p>

            <p TEIform="p">The most important change provided for by the Act of 1837 was the
               appointment of County Boards of Education. These boards, unlike the County Boards
               recently inaugurated in New Brunswick, which are for financial purposes only, were
               not finance boards but examining boards. Each board was to consist of three or more
               persons appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council for the purpose of receiving
               applications from persons desiring to obtain parish school licenses, and for the
               examination at an early and convenient time of the moral character, literary
               attainments, and loyal principles of such applicants. Those candidates who were
               reported to the Lieutenant-Governor by the County Boards as being suitable persons to
               enter upon the important and responsible duty of teaching would then receive licenses
               valid for the County for which they were issued.<note target="n6.3" anchored="yes"
                  TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">3</hi>
               </note>
            </p>

            <p TEIform="p">This step towards centralization was designed to prevent undesirables
               from entering the teaching profession and to introduce a degree of uniformity into
               the licensing of teachers. The difficulty, however, of finding qualified men willing
               to act as unpaid members of such examining bodies operated against the continuance of
               County Boards, especially when in 1847 a Normal School was established and the
               examination of teachers for license could then be carried through on a provincial
               basis.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">According to the Act of 1837 County Boards were to investigate not only
               the character and learning of prospective teachers but their loyalty as well. In
               1837, when rebellion was seething in the Canadas, New Brunswick was especially
               conscious of that loyalty, which, according to a correspondent of Sir John Harvey's,
               prevented any disloyal subject from daring to raise his voice.<note target="n6.4"
                  anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">4</hi>
               </note> There seems, however, to have been difficulty in procuring for this loyal
               people school texts imbued with the proper sentiment. In a letter to Sir John Harvey
               reporting on some elementary school books, Edwin Jacob, vice-principal of King's,
               observed that there was little, if anything, in any of the publications calculated to
               answer His Excellency's avowed purpose of conveying to the youthful mind English
               impressions of men and things, and went on to say that he thought that even the
               British and Foreign School Society, could its agency be employed, would be found <q

               commissioned by Sir John Harvey from England, and reported on to the Assembly in 1839
               by Jacob and George Roberts, Headmaster of the Collegiate School, but at any rate the
               same fault was found on this occasion. Commenting on the History of England contained

               that it could be pronounced <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">a bold

               </note> A little later in the year approved books were sent to the several County
               Boards of Education for distribution, under the direction of the members for the
               respective counties, but there is nothing in the Journal to indicate whether the
               books censured by Jacob and Roberts were included or not. At this same session the
               Lt.-Governor, Sir John Harvey, suggested that besides the books sent gratuitously to
               the Boards of Education a number should be imported at the public expense, placed in
               the charge of individuals in the principal towns and ports, and retailed by them at
               their wholesale prime cost, that thus parents might obtain books upon terms far more
               reasonable than could be procured anywhere out of England.<note target="n6.7"

               </note> There is no evidence that this suggestion was carried out at the time, and
               the text book situation in the province continued shocking. In 1841 Lt.-Governor
               Colebrooke wrote; <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">In many schools
                  there are no books and in some the selection of books is objectionable; the

               </note> A year later, Colebrooke's son-in-law and secretary, Alfred Reade, in
               submitting observations to the Assembly on the reports of trustees of parish schools,
               referred to the great variety and inferior character of the books used in the parish

               by the Trustees of Charlotte County that most of the books used there were American,
               these being procured so much more easily than others.<note target="n6.10"

               </note> Finally, when all the schools of the province were inspected in 1844 by a
               committee especially appointed for the purpose, that section of the Inspectors'
               report dealing with books declared that a list of texts in use in the province would
               present a catalogue of nearly every elementary work, of more than local celebrity,
               published within the previous seventy years. The Inspectors found that in some
               schools the Spelling Book and the New Testament were the only reading books. There
               was great need, they said, of a text on which the intellect of the children could be
               exercised, as explanations were not usually attempted on the Bible.<note

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">11</hi>
               </note> Steps to remedy all these deficiencies had to wait, however, for the
               establishment of a Board of Education in 1847, a development which was part of an
               impulse that energized education generally at that time.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">Considerable credit for initiating this impulse must be given His <pb
                  n="92" id="p92" TEIform="pb"/> Majesty's representatives in the province. Sir John
               Harvey, shortly before he left New Brunswick, declared that the establishment of a
               training institution for teachers was the great desideratum and that he had omitted
               no occasion of bringing this question under the consideration of the
                  legislature.<note target="n6.12" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">12</hi>
               </note> His successor, Sir William Colebrooke, seems to have seen, from the very
               beginning of his governorship, what the chief problem was. In one of his early
               dispatches he observed: <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">Under the
                  law which provides for the payment of an inadequate stipend to a teacher and a
                  local contribution of board and lodging and washing, respectable persons have not
                  been found to take the appointments . . . . I apprehend that the system of
                  instruction pursued in the parochial schools is very inefficient</q>.<note
                  target="n6.13" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">13</hi>
               </note> We find that a few months later he wrote to Lord Stanley that he was
               proposing the formation of a model school at Fredericton, and he inquired if
               competent persons might not be secured in England to come out in the ensuing spring.
               He pointed out that the system of instruction must be adapted to a country where the
               schools included children of all Christian denominations, and he expressed the
               opinion that if a man and his wife could be found who would be willing to accept £
               200 a year, they would be able to establish a good model school, and with the aid of
               a local assistant could train ten or twelve females as teachers at a time, to supply
               the country schools.<note target="n6.14" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">14</hi>
               </note> Evidently Colebrooke was shrewd enough to realize that the needs of this
               small and educationally backward colony could not be adequately met by a sectarian
               training school, for in this same dispatch he said competent instructors for a model
               school could be readily obtained through the assistance of the religious societies in
               England, but he feared that this method might tend to excite jealousy in persons of
               other denominations. He believed that if the Committee of the Privy Council should
               procure fit persons for the training school, such teachers would meet with general
               support. Half a year later Colebrooke, although bitterly disappointed that the
               Assembly had not provided funds to carry out his plans for training teachers,
               reiterated his belief in a non-sectarian institution, saying: <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">A liberal offer was made by the Colonial Church
                  Society to establish a training school here at their own expense but the offer I
                  declined, being of the opinion that such a school if expressly established by a
                  religious society would fail in acquiring that general support from all
                  denominations which would render it extensively useful</q>. To this he added: <q
                  rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">The Madras Schools have on this
                  account been less successful than they might otherwise have been</q>.<note

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">15</hi>
               </note> This determination of Sir William Colebrooke's that New Brunswick's first
               normal school should be free of denominational control forms an interesting contrast
               to the Anglican spirit of monopoly which presided as a matter of course at the
               founding of the College of New Brunswick, and is significant of the changes which
               time had brought.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">The failure of the Assembly to vote money for teacher training caused Sir
               William not only disappointment but also some embarrassment. The Home <pb n="93"
                  id="p93" TEIform="pb"/> Authorities, in response to his request, had engaged a Mr.
               and Mrs. Dixon to come out for the purpose of taking charge of the proposed model
               school, and the couple had waited in London for several months for exact instructions
               from New Brunswick. When the Assembly disappointed Colebrooke by failing to vote the
               sums necessary to the carrying out of his scheme, the province had to reimburse Mr.
               and Mrs. Dixon for the loss of their time and expectations.<note target="n6.16"
                  anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </note>
            </p>


            <p TEIform="p">In noting the Assembly's hesitation to launch in 1842 a scheme in the
               interests of educational improvement, involving an annual expenditure of £ 200, we
               remember that at this time the province was in debt, but we also remember, that five
               years before, it had had a large credit which the Assembly had frittered away in the
               meantime. We note, too, that in this colony unable to find funds for a training
               school the chief official positions were monopolized by a few families, and carried
               with them salaries disproportionately high. Colebrooke was quite aware of the popular
               resentment against the Family Compact, and of the reasons for it. In one dispatch he
               spoke of the <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">tendency of the
                  prevailing system to render the public service of the province the patrimony of a
                  few colonial families</q> and went on to say that <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">when this influence is known to have been so
                  effectually exerted not only in securing the succession of the principal offices
                  in the same families but in preventing a reduction of the undue emoluments
                  attaching to them, it is not surprising that in a season of distress the jealousy
                  of the public should have been more than ordinarily awakened</q>.<note

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">17</hi>
               </note> But Colebrooke also saw that the Assembly was not blameless either. He
               expressed himself so often and so clearly on the necessity of having executive
               responsibility for the initiation of money grants that in this connection his
               successor, Sir Edmund Head, could say in the year 1848: <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">I believe that the soundness of Sir William
                  Colebrooke's views is beginning to be felt</q>.<note target="n6.18" anchored="yes"

               </note> Colebrooke was Lieutenant-Governor of New Brunswick at a time when the
               political and financial problems of the province were extremely troublesome. Whatever
               his administrative errors, credit is due him for his keen interest in the social
               welfare of a <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">rugged</q> people whom
               he wished to see subdued <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">to the
                  useful and the good</q>. One feels that, like Ulysses, he was impatient of <q
                  rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">soft degrees</q>, and one can
               imagine that he often experienced a sense of frustration. Possibly that was so in
               1842. But, although disappointed, he continued to revolve plans aiming at improved
               educational conditions. We find that in one of the dispatches in which he expressed
               regret at having had to relinquish the prospect of a model school he suggested that
               perhaps Mr. and Mrs. Dixon could come out under the auspices of the British Board of
               Education, with a guarantee for their stipend until funds could be provided in New
               Brunswick. He pointed out that large funds were raised in England, and parliamentary
               grants obtained, for the education of the negro population in the West Indies.
               Considering, said he, the wealth of those colonies <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">in contrast with the limited resources of these
                  provinces, where so many of the most ignorant and indigent <pb n="94" id="p94"
                     TEIform="pb"/> classes of British Emigrants are annually settled</q>, it was
               not unreasonable <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">to hope some
                  assistance may be given in the present depressed state of the local finances in
                  the province for the proper training of a multitude of children on whose character
                  may hereafter depend the preservation of the relations of this Province as a

               </note> Colebrooke may have seriously thought that this suggestion would be acted on,
               for a month later he wrote to George Dibblee, Clerk of the Peace for York County,
               asking him to bring under the consideration of the magistrates the importance of
               preserving the buildings and grounds of the old jail, at that time vacant, for the
               establishment of a Central Training School.<note target="n6.20" anchored="yes"

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">20</hi>
               </note> However, a dispatch to Stanley written in August, a few weeks after the
               letter to Dibblee, indicated that he had given up hope of establishing such an
               institution in the near future, and explained that the disappointment of the
               expectations he had formed previous to the last session had arisen from the unlooked
               for reception by the Assembly of the financial changes which he had proposed.<note
                  target="n6.21" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">21</hi>
               </note> It was at this session that Colebrooke, at the request of the Colonial
               Secretary, had brought before the House the question of the disordered provincial
                  finances,<note target="n6.22" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">22</hi>
               </note> and that the absurd amendment, referred to earlier, had been passed by the
               opponents of reform in support of the old method of making appropriations. It would
               appear, from Colebrooke's reference, that those who objected to political and
               financial reforms hindered the establishment of a Normal School because it was
               proposed by the same man who had suggested the unpopular financial reforms. This
               means, if Colebrooke diagnosed correctly the reasons for the failure of his Normal
               School project, that we have found evidence indeed to support our earlier statement
               that in New Brunswick a question was often judged not by its relation to the public
               interest but by its connection with individuals.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">Continuing with Colebrooke's dispatch of August 12, 1842, we find that to
               his regrets at the loss of the services of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon he added another
               regret, namely, that the condition of the common schools should not have been
               investigated, for <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">to the enquiries
                  which were prosecuted in Canada may be attributed the facilities with which a
                  reform in the system has been there effected</q>. He then made the following
               interesting observation: <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">As the
                  inhabitants</q> (of New Brunswick) <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified"
                  TEIform="q">possess but limited means of judging by comparison, they are little
                  conscious of the great defects in the schools and of the serious consequences of
                  these on the prospect of the rising generation, which I consider to be a question
                  of national interest</q>. The example of an efficient model school would, he
               thought, enable the members of the Legislature and other influential persons to
               estimate the defects of the present system, and would induce them to apply an early
               and effectual remedy.<note target="n6.23" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               such had not yet been done and hinted at some of the difficulties in the way of
               progress. <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">So many individual <pb

            <p TEIform="p">Although the session of 1842 was unproductive of legislation relating to
               schools, the Assembly did appoint a committee on education, of which Wilmot was

               classes was a subject of national and provincial importance; expressed fear that in
               many rural districts there was an extraordinary degree of apathy among parents and
               guardians; referred to the necessity of a normal school; and hoped that the subject

               Charlotte County there occurred this statement: <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified"
                  TEIform="q">The poorer classes frequently, from a feeling of false pride, and the
                  notion that they become in a manner Parish paupers by sending their children on
                  the Provincial allowance, leave them to grow up in ignorance; the few of such
                  class who attend have been sought out by the Trustees</q>.<note target="n6.26"

               </note> Is this not of some significance in relation to our earlier designation of
               parish schools as institutions for the poor? If the people felt that attendance at
               the parish schools stigmatized them as paupers, may not that have been because the
               well-to-do had long considered parish schools as synonymous with pauper schools?<note

            <p TEIform="p">Another interesting point to be noted in the Trustees' Reports of 1842
               occurs in connection with reports from the parishes of Northumberland County.
               Blissfield Parish reported using <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q"
                  >some of the latest improvements which have been made in the method of teaching in
                  the Scottish Juvenile Schools</q>. Newcastle reported that the system taught was
               that of the common school system in Scotland, and that the books used chiefly were
               those published by the Society of Schoolmasters or Murray.<note target="n6.28"

               </note> Evidently teachers from among the Scottish folk of the Miramichi relied on
               whatever training, experience, and tests they had brought with them from Scotland,
               but the Trustees' reports do not indicate what particular methods peculiar to
               Scottish schools were in use on the Miramichi.<note target="n6.29" anchored="yes"

            <p TEIform="p">In general, the trustees who reported in 1842 complained of poorly
               qualified teachers, expressed the opinion that the schools of the country could not
               be advantageously conducted until a more respectable class of teachers should be
               procured, and declared that this could not be done without some Central Training
                  School.<note target="n6.30" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               <pb n="96" id="p96" TEIform="pb"/> Besides these reports, there was available to the
               Assembly of 1842 a series of letters to the County Boards of Education, written in
               1841 by the Provincial Secretary, W. F. Odell, but inspired by the Lt.-Governor's
               enthusiasm and desire for information. One of these letters asked the Boards to
               recommend a better mode of local remuneration to teachers than the existing one of
               board and washing, and sought the reactions of the county bodies to the possibility
               of having a house and plot of land attached to each school to assist in the
               maintenance of the master, and to furnish an opportunity for the instruction of the
               boys in improved methods of husbandry.<note target="n6.31" anchored="yes"

               </note> It is interesting to discover that nearly a hundred years before the school
               curriculum of New Brunswick was modified to meet the needs of children in rural areas
               there was talk of teaching agriculture in the schools. The emphasis then, however,
               seems to have been on the benefits to agriculture, whereas the modern emphasis is
               social and civic as well as economic. In another letter, Odell said that he had been
               directed by the Lieutenant-Governor to intimate that the practice of employing
               females in charge of schools where the children of both sexes were instructed was
               extending rapidly in England, and that His Excellency wished to be informed if
               respectable women between the ages of twenty-five and forty could be found to
               undertake the charge of the parish schools, and would come to Fredericton for the
               necessary training when the Normal School should be established. A third letter
               referred to the success of a Normal Training system in England and the West
                  Indies.<note target="n6.32" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

            <p TEIform="p">The Journal of 1842 informs us that in addition to these reports and
               letters another document dealing with education was available for the information of
               such legislators as had ears to hear. This was a commentary by Alfred Reade,
               Colebrooke's Secretary, on the Reports of the Trustees. Again the necessity of an
               institution for training teachers was stressed, and the obstacles in the province, in
               the way of any plan having in view competency and respectability on the part of
               teachers, were discussed. The first of these obstacles was the insufficiency and
               uncertainty in the mode of remuneration. The surest way, said Reade, to lower the
               value of education in the eyes of the people was to pay teachers a sum inadequate to
               the wants and necessities of any respectable person. To do this gave the masses the
               idea that education was of secondary importance since its professors were worse paid
               than people in any other trade or occupation, and produced a feeling that no one
               would occupy himself in teaching if he could make his living in any other way. Thus
               the teacher was regarded as a needy adventurer and his character lowered in the eyes
               of scholars and parents. Other obstacles were the mode of payment, the variety of
               text books, the irregular operation of schools, and the ugliness and discomfort of
               the school buildings. Reade also sympathized with the trustees for the expense,
               inconvenience, and loss of time which school visitation entailed, and said that the
               trustees should be allowed travelling expenses. He also expressed uneasiness over the
               fact that the trustees' reports revealed an absence of all religious in- <pb n="97"
                  id="p97" TEIform="pb"/> struction in many schools. Finally, the question raised in
               the previous autumn in one of Odell's letters, namely, the formation of agricultural
               schools, received some comment. The Trustees and County Boards of Education
               generally, Reade thought, did not favor the idea, being under the impression that
               parents would consider that their children were much better employed on their own
               farms. In a new country, observed Reade, the value of instruction in improved methods
               of husbandry was not appreciated.<note target="n6.33" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

            <p TEIform="p">Thus we see that although the bulk of the population may have been, as
               Colebrooke thought, in no position to understand the gravity of the educational
               situation, the Legislature of 1842 did have before it considerable information which
               might have prompted immediate action. How thoughtfully all these reports and letters
               dealing with various aspects of education were read, or listened to, by members of
               the Assembly we do not know. At any rate, no action was taken during the sessions of
               1842 and 1843, which were both agitated by constitutional and financial disputes. But
               in 1844 the House voted £ 500 to the Lieutenant-Governor, to institute an efficient
               inspection of the parish schools and all other schools receiving pecuniary aid from
               the public treasury.<note target="n6.34" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">34</hi>
               </note> His Excellency and other advocates of reform were hopeful that the facts such
               an enquiry might reveal would lead to constructive measures of reform. Colebrooke
               wrote to Stanley that the inspection was being made with a view to amending the
               school law which expired in 1845, adding: <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified"
                  TEIform="q">At which time I hope that the defects of the schools will be so
                  generally ascertained and acknowledged that local interests will not prevail
                  against the adoption of an improved system, and the establishment of a model and
                  training school which would be an essential preliminary.</q>

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">35</hi>
               </note> Possibly, however, there were individuals who yielded to the Governor's
               wishes for an enquiry merely because such an investigation would require time, and
               would, therefore, push further off into the future the necessity of decision on the
               larger question of a normal school.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">The report of the Inspectors, James Brown, S. Z. Earle, and John Gregory,
               was presented to the Assembly during the session of 1845, and is of considerable
               length. Later it was published in pamphlet form.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">First, the Inspectors noted that the Parish Schools received £ 12,000
               annually in the form of Treasury grants. This sum, in comparison with the amount
               granted for the encouragement of the common schools in the United States and in the
               Sister Colonies of New Brunswick, was exceedingly generous, but if reports and
               official documents might be believed, the youth of New Brunswick were far behind
               theirs in the elementary and useful knowledge upon which the well-being of a free
               people materially depended.<note target="n6.36" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </note>
            </p>

            <p TEIform="p">Regarding the state of school buildings, the report described some
               appalling conditions. In one school, in operation for six months, there were no pens,
               ink, paper, slates, pencils, or desks, Benches were the only furniture, and they were
               four to six inches too high. In another school, inspected on the <pb n="98" id="p98"
                  TEIform="pb"/> eighteenth of November, there were fifteen broken panes of glass,
               and the children were shivering. Another was apparently the kitchen of a private
               dwelling. Not more than eight schools, including the Grammar Schools, were provided
               with even a good-sized map of the world.<note target="n6.37" anchored="yes"
                  TEIform="note">

               </note>
            </p>

            <p TEIform="p">That part of the Inspectors' report dealing with teachers and quality of
               teaching furnished evidence convincing enough, surely, to impress the most doubting
               of Thomases with the need of a normal school. A number of the teachers, according to
               the report, could not dictate words for spelling without hesitation. Many knew
               neither the names nor the uses of punctuation marks. Some did not profess to teach
               any Arithmetic, and many who did were very deficient. For instance, several were
               unable to make up the average attendance of their scholars. The number of those who
               claimed to give instruction in English Grammar, Geography, Bookkeeping, and
               Mathematics was great in proportion to the number actually capable of teaching these
               subjects. Many teachers were reported as not being in the custom of attending to the
               meaning of what they read, and a number read imperfectly. Of one teacher, who had
               been seventeen years in a district, the report said: <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">The teacher's education is defective and his
                  teaching without method</q>. One teacher did not know the difference between a
               vowel and a consonant. A number of teachers, (females presumably), were reported as
               better qualified to teach needlework than any literary branch of school education,
               being incompetent to teach Spelling, Reading, Writing, and Arithmetic. It was
               observed in a number of schools that the teachers engaged personally in sewing and
               knitting. In many schools the pupils read words only, having no idea of the sense or
               of the punctuation. In many schools Reading and Spelling were the main subjects
               taught. One teacher claimed that he had lost pupils by insisting on their learning
               Arithmetic and Writing. In Writing, the disposition was to have the pupils follow set
               lines. As a consequence they failed to learn punctuation, the commencement of
               paragraphs, and the use of capital letters.<note target="n6.38" anchored="yes"
                  TEIform="note">

            </p>

            <p TEIform="p">While one may doubt the suitability of the Book of Revelations as a
               reading lesson, nevertheless, the way in which the lesson was handled by one teacher
               is astonishing indeed. This teacher had selected as a reading lesson the seventh
               chapter of Revelations, beginning: <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q"
                  >And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the
                  earth, holding the four winds of the earth</q>. When prompted by the Inspectors,
               the teacher was unable to tell the children to whom the <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">I</q> referred, what it was John saw, and what
               the angels were said to be doing. The Inspectors were told by a trustee of a school
               where the teacher had taught before that the pupils there were more deficient after
               eighteen months than before they entered the school.<note target="n6.39"
                  anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">39</hi>
               </note> From all these circumstances the Inspectors were forced to conclude that many
               teachers were incompetent because of lack of scholarship; others had little or no
               knowledge of human character, and were destitute of the faculty or energy to enable
               them to enforce <pb n="99" id="p99" TEIform="pb"/> obedience, and at the same time
               retain the goodwill of their pupils; still worse, many lacked the faculty, zeal, or
               will to communicate instruction in a manner suited to the capacities and conditions
               of their pupils.<note target="n6.40" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </note>
            </p>

            <p TEIform="p">When discussing the schoolbook question on an earlier page we noted that
               this board of inspection found a variety of books, but of inadequate number and
               quality. Frequently the New Testament was used for reading lessons, but mechanically,
               as in the illustration just given. However, in some cases, where expounding was
               attempted, the Inspector who commented on the circumstance thought it were better to
               have none. It was speaking at random, and was no doctrine of which he had ever heard.
               Religious instruction, he thought, was therefore better left to Sunday Schools and
               ministers. In many schools the Catechism was recited. Not infrequently the Catechisms
               of two or three opposing sects were taught in the same school&#8212;a source of
               annoyance to intelligent teachers.<note target="n6.41" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </note>
            </p>

            <p TEIform="p">The reasons listed by the Inspectors for the poor general state of the
               parish schools were those which the details of their report had revealed, viz.,
               apathy of the people, incompetence of the teachers, the limited amount of that part
               of the teachers' income derived directly from the people and the unsatisfactory mode
               of payment, defective apparatus and books, inadequate buildings, and imperfect
               supervision and control. Among the remedies which the Inspectors suggested was the
               diffusion of information on the object and power of education, through the increase
               of professional intelligence of teachers, and the benevolent co-operation of the
               clergy and the press. They also advocated a training-school in Fredericton that
               teachers might be instructed in the conduct and management of schools; and a model
               school, where they might obtain practical experience. If intelligence were to be
               introduced and maintained in the profession, there must be increased emoluments. The
               Inspectors hoped that the principle of assessment would soon be adopted, and they
               recommended the introduction of suitable uniform books. They thought that the powers
               of the trustees should be expanded, and that provision should be made for an
               inspection to aid them in their duties. Finally, they suggested that a provincial
               Board of Education should be constituted of the Governor in Council, with powers to
               establish a Training School, to recommend books, appoint Inspectors, and prescribe
               forms of school registers and returns.<note target="n6.42" anchored="yes"

            <p TEIform="p">Turning from the Parish Schools to the special schools of the province
               which were investigated by the Inspectors, we find that these schools received good
               reports. The Fredericton Infant School, in its third year of operation at the time of
               the report, was described as experimental so far as the province was concerned, and
               tribute was paid to Lady Colebrooke and other ladies, whose benevolent exertions were
               responsible for the origin and principal support of the school. The Inspectors
               thought that in an educational scheme such a school might be regarded as preparatory,
               only, to the reception of knowledge, by regu- <pb n="100" id="p100" TEIform="pb"/>

               </note> We may presume that Lady Colebrooke knew something of the Infant Schools in
               England, but whether or not she and the ladies who assisted her were acquainted with
               Pestalozzian ideas, as was Robert Owen, the founder of this type of school,<note

            <p TEIform="p">The Inspectors were able to commend the discipline and general efficiency
               of the Madras Schools, but one of the Inspectors doubted if the pupils derived all
               the benefits which the system was intended to confer, owing to the practice of the

               </note> Here was one man who realized the mechanical nature of the instruction given
               in the Madras Schools.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">Sackville Academy, which owed its foundation in 1842 to the philanthropy
               and Methodist zeal of Charles F. Allison, was given a good report by James Brown, the
               Inspector who visited that young institution. He mentioned particularly the oral
               instruction and use of maps which he found in practice, and also the fact that the
               pupils were accustomed to putting their own geometry figures and arithmetic exercises
               on the board, and demonstrating them. He concluded that the Wesleyan Academy was,
               perhaps, the very best educational institution in the province.<note target="n6.46"

            <p TEIform="p">For some reason the Baptist Seminary at Fredericton was overlooked by the
               examiners, although, like the Wesleyan Academy and the Church of England Madras
               Schools, it received a provincial grant. However, the compiler of the Abstract stated
               that it was examined in the course of the year by Messrs. the Honorable Saunders and
               Wilmot and the Reverend Mr. Brooke, and had received a favorable report. The granting
               of provincial aid to this school seems to have set a kind of precedent for
               legislative aid to denominational schools other than Anglican. Evidently the Baptists
               had had to fight custom and Church of England monopoly in order to get the financial
               support they finally did receive, for an item in the Chatham Gleaner of April 2,
               1839, told of the meeting of the New Brunswick Baptist Educational Society at
               Fredericton, and their protest against the continued rejection of an appeal for a
               grant to their seminary. The grant, the item went on to say, was passed each year in
               the House of Assembly, but was rejected by the Legislative Council on the grounds
               that their principle was against giving money in aid of religious or literary
               institutions for the dissemination of their own peculiar tenets. The article
               proceeded to deny that the Baptist Seminary taught Baptist tenets, and pointed out
               that the province annually bestowed £ 2200 on King's College, although it was
               Episcopalian, and £ 400 a year on the Madras Schools, although they taught the
               Anglican Catechism.<note target="n6.47" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">47</hi>
               </note> Finally, in 1842, the Council gave way, and the <pb n="101" id="p101"

            <p TEIform="p">Thereafter, for many years, this institution received an annual grant,
               and from that time forward we find a particularly large variety of schools, many of
               them denominational, receiving provincial aid. While this was distinctly fairer than
               the earlier custom of subsidizing Anglican institutions and ignoring others, it
               furnishes another illustration of the haphazard way in which the Assembly
               appropriated the public money for local and sectional uses, and shows that the idea
               that state aid should mean a measure, at least, of state supervision and control
               developed but slowly in New Brunswick. However, one must admit that in this
               connection New Brunswick had company, for we are told that in America the colonial
               practice of granting public subsidies to educational institutions more or less under
               the control of religious groups was not abandoned until the middle of the nineteenth
                  century.<note target="n6.49" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

            <p TEIform="p">While the Inspection instituted in 1844 was supposed to cover all schools
               receiving provincial aid, for some reason the Inspectors limited their report on the
               Grammar Schools to a few brief paragraphs. But in 1846 a committee of the House,
               consisting of Brown, Earle, Rankine, Wilmot, and Wark, was appointed, and their more
               lengthy report on these schools was presented to the Assembly during the session. If
               anything, the Grammar Schools were criticized more severely than had been the Parish
               Schools. The Inspectors said that undoubtedly the intention of the Legislature, in
               endowing the Grammar Schools, had been to establish a superior school for each
               county, wherein might be taught those higher branches of learning not available in
               the ordinary schools. The Inspectors were therefore surprised, they said, to find
               that the endowment of £ 100 per annum had been drawn for the support of several
               Grammar Schools which were not conducted according to the intention of the
               Legislature, and were actually inferior to many of the Parish Schools. Figures were
               submitted in the report showing that in seven Grammar Schools of the province only a
               few pupils were being instructed in the branches of education specified in the
               Grammar School Act of 1829. Only the Grammar Schools of Saint John and Northumberland
               Counties were reported as being in an efficient state. To remedy the existing evils
               the Inspectors recommended immediate legislation. Under the law, as it was, the only
               requirement for obtaining the provincial grant was that the trustees certify there
               was a school house, a competent master, and £ 50 subscribed by the inhabitants. A
               number of amendments were now suggested relating to average attendance, number of
               pupils enrolled in the higher branches, and masters' and trustees' reports,
               suggestions all designed to elevate the standard of the Grammar Schools, with a
               threat of forfeiture of part of the grant if efficiency were not maintained.<note

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">50</hi>
               </note> At last the idea was evolving in connection with even those favored
               institutions, the Grammar Schools, that financial support should entail supervision
               and responsibility for efficiency.</p>



            <pb n="102" id="p102" TEIform="pb"/>

            <p TEIform="p">One cannot read the school reports of 1845 and 1846 without a feeling of
               curiosity about general intellectual conditions throughout New Brunswick one hundred
               years ago. Was the depressed state of education in particular but one facet of a
               society insensitive to things cultural, or had the school system, ossified by custom
               and tradition, and weighted with the indifference of certain sections of the
               population, merely failed to catch up with a nascent, yet vigorous, intellectual
               life? From such investigation of the subject as has been possible in this study, an
               affirmative to both questions cannot be entirely rejected. Indifference to education
               can hardly be interpreted as anything else but an indication of a society culturally
               poor because of economic stringencies, geographical isolation, or materialistic
               ideals. We observed earlier that much of New Brunswick society was still in the
               pioneer stage during this period, or was barely emerging from it. Generally speaking,
               the material aspects of civilization are the first to commend themselves to a society
               just beginning to reach out beyond bare existence toward richer living, while the
               cultural graces and adornments, totally neglected during the pioneer stage, are slow
               to gain appreciation, especially appreciation in the form of any considerable
               expenditure of that material wealth which may have come to be regarded as the symbol
               of progress. There will always be individual exceptions to this, of course, and even
               national exceptions, Scotland being a case in point, but it does seem that in New
               Brunswick, whatever the reasons, the great bulk of the population, rural and urban,
               was characterized by intellectual lethargy.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">On the other hand, there were certain elements in the provincial society
               with which such books, music, and lectures as were available found acceptance. One
               thinks of the capital, centre of the official and Family Compact classes, but we are
               told that official life at Fredericton, as at Halifax, was gay, rather than
                  intellectual,<note target="n6.51" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </note> due to the entertainments of the royal Governors and the presence of military
               officers who imparted <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">a degree of

               </note> In 1830, however, there was a subscription library, offering a variety of
               entertaining and standard works,<note target="n6.53" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">53</hi>
               </note> and always the presence of King's College contributed an intellectual tone.
               Yet, in truth, that institution, graduating a scanty number of students annually at
               what seemed to the province a great cost, seems to have stood rather aloof in an
               academic world of its own, blindly preparing, it may be, to help nourish that later
               curious flowering which has made the names of Roberts and Carman known throughout
               Canada. Of the professors at King's in the forties and fifties, James Robb appears to
               have made the greatest contribution to the life of the province. He was for many
               years connected with the Fredericton Athanaeum,<note target="n6.54" anchored="yes"

               Sir Edmund Head, he gave a course of lectures in Fredericton on agricultural
                  chemistry.<note target="n6.55" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </note> At considerable expenditure of time he compiled in 1849 an Almanac, in which
               he inserted much information about the province, such as tables of tidal changes,
               rates of duty, revenue returns, and lists of the executive and legislative
               departments of the government. In the preface to this work he declared: <q

                  food for the mind is but scantily supplied, care ought to be taken that the poor

                  find in the latter something more nourishing than the chaff of Astrology, Alchemy

               chemistry and botany. We do not find, however, that this was adopted as a text, as

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">59</hi>
               </note> we feel like suggesting that it was probably beyond the understanding of many
               of the teachers as well. On the other hand, although it may have been used but little
               in the schools at the time, it must have added to the sum-total of influences which,
               more and more, were directing attention to the new world opened up by science.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">We have already noted that Gesner and Johnston contributed to the
               scientific knowledge of New Brunswick. Doubtless other transients in the province did
               too. To what degree the shipping merchants and lumber kings contributed to provincial
               learning and culture is not readily apparent. Since they were able to send their
               children abroad, or to educate them at home by means of private tutors, it is not
               surprising that they do not seem to have agitated themselves over the poor state of
               the common schools. We are tempted to think that, as <q rend="inline"

               the fashion of Joseph Cunard on the Miramichi,<note target="n6.60" anchored="yes"

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">60</hi>
               </note> the majority afforded to the rank and file pleasing glimpses of an enviable
               world of comfort and elegance, rather than one of learning and literary culture. It
               may, however, be no coincidence that during the heyday of the lumber industry on the
               Miramichi the Northumberland County Grammar School was well reported, there were
               several advertisements of ambitious-sounding private schools, and the Miramichi
               Gleaner could report a number of intellectual and social activities. There was a
               Young Men's Debating Society in Chatham in 1837, scheduled to discuss at one of its
               meetings three features of the British Constitution&#8212;the liberty of the press,
               representation of the people in parliament, and trial by jury. We note a Dancing
               Academy in Newcastle in 1837, a course of phrenological lectures in Chatham in 1841,
               a singing class in 1844&#8212;terms ten shillings a quarter&#8212;and a Mechanics'
               Institute in 1846, which <pb n="104" id="p104" TEIform="pb"/> included the Honorable
               Joseph Cunard as a member of its body corporate.<note target="n6.61" anchored="yes"

               </note>
            </p>

            <p TEIform="p">With the introduction of the subject of Mechanics' Institutes we must
               turn our attention again to Britain, since those institutions came to New Brunswick
               from the Mother Country, where the slow development of the idea of state-supported
               education for all provided ample scope for a motley of educational agencies.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">The earliest movement towards special institutions for the industrial
               classes was philanthropic,<note target="n6.62" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">62</hi>
               </note> but other influences obtained besides that philanthropy which had promoted as
               many religious and educational societies during the eighteenth and early nineteenth
               centuries. Since the exploitation of humanity which had accompanied the Industrial
               Revolution provided even wider opportunities, than earlier, for measures designed to
               ameliorate the lot of unfortunates, the philanthropic aspect of Mechanics' Institutes
               cannot be completely discounted, but there were other aspects. The Industrial
               Revolution had focused attention on men, not only as human beings, but also as
               workers, whose efficiency might be increased through knowledge, particularly
               scientific knowledge. Besides this, the trend towards political democracy was
               emphasizing more and more the potential power of the masses, and the expediency of
               educating them for active citizenship. Thus the doctrine of education for all,
               formerly only the dream of philosophers and idealists, began to appear in the light
               of a practical safeguard, both social and national.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">The history of the Mechanics' Institute can be traced from Birmingham and
               Glasgow. In the former city a Sunday Society was formed in 1789, for the purpose of
               keeping the members of the Sunday School together by means of lectures in mechanics
               and physical education. The Glasgow Mechanics' Institute was established in 1823,
               having grown out of lectures given by Birkbeck to meet the needs of the artisan
               classes. Shortly after, London and Manchester had similar institutions, and by 1850
               there were 610 literary and mechanics' associations throughout Britain. The movement
               met with great enthusiasm, but we are told that it is doubtful if the Institutes
               always attracted the people for whom they were intended. Obviously, the artisan and
               lower classes lacked the educational foundation to profit by the institutions; in
               many cases the lectures must have been over their heads, and the fees for membership
               and classes beyond their means.<note target="n6.63" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">63</hi>
               </note>
            </p>

            <p TEIform="p">In New Brunswick, the majority of such Institutes were, of necessity, in
               small towns and villages. We may suppose, therefore, that the benefits were mainly
               social, moral, and in the interests of general education, rather than of assistance
               to industry. Several of the Institutes seem to have been associated with Temperance
               Societies, which were becoming popular at this time as part of the temperance
               movement which was sweeping the New England States. Records indicate that the
               earliest Mechanics' Institute in New Brunswick was the <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">Hillsborough Temperance Hall and Mechanics'
                  Institute</q>, for the purpose of <pb n="105" id="p105" TEIform="pb"/>
               disseminating temperance principles, and instructing mechanics in the different
               branches of science. In 1839 the Mechanics Institute of Saint John was incorporated,
               and in a few years there were groups at Chatham, Hampton, Dorchester, Woodstock,
               Newcastle, and other points.<note target="n6.64" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">64</hi>
               </note>
            </p>

            <p TEIform="p">From the reports of the Saint John Institute&#8212;the largest in the
               province&#8212;and from the titles and nature of the lectures delivered there, we can
               gain some idea of the aims and benefits of the movement in New Brunswick. An early
               report by the Board of Directors attributed to the authorities of enlightened and
               civilized countries, particularly Great Britain, a keen desire to promote the
               cultivation of the arts and sciences, and deduced that in British Colonies the spirit
               of the Mother Country would naturally extend itself. In any country, said the report,
               where Collegiate and Academy instruction could not become general, any system whereby
               useful information was given to all classes must be of the highest importance to the
               welfare and prosperity of the country, especially when the instruction given was
               calculated to act immediately upon the daily occupations of the several trades. The
               report acknowledged the avidity with which the humbler classes sought knowledge when
               it was offered at their very doors, and declared, significantly, that it was not
               necessary today to bring forward evidence of the importance of education to all
               orders of men. Facts were then submitted relating to the establishment and
               meeting-places of the society, which in 1841 numbered 560 on its membership roll. In
               view of the expense of the new hall the Legislature was solicited for a grant of £
               800. The report concluded with a tribute to the moral benefits of the Institute in
               providing a place of recreation for tradesmen, who used to spend their evenings in
               idle games or criminal indulgence, but were now attracted by the beauties of science
               and were daily becoming acquainted with those branches of knowledge upon which their
               prosperity and happiness mainly depended.<note target="n6.65" anchored="yes"

            <p TEIform="p">It may be that lectures were sometimes delivered for the self-display of
               the speakers or for the edification of the learned sponsors of the programme, but, on
               the whole, Mechanics' Institutes, as an early form of adult education, contributed to
               the social and intellectual life of the communities where they functioned. From the
               standpoint of the development of educational theory, the establishment of such
               associations was significant as illustrative of the growth of the idea of education
               for all classes. The Saint John body continued until 1890,<note target="n6.70"

               province seem to have lapsed, or deteriorated into literary or temperance societies,
               or mere social clubs.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">If we may take the community described in Mrs. Beavan's interesting
               little book, <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">Pioneer Life in New
                  Brunswick</q>, as a typical section of New Brunswick one hundred years ago, we

               stimulate the thinking of country people at that time. Actually this particular area
               on the lower Saint John must have been above the average, for it started a library.
               Speaking of this, Mrs. Beavan wrote: <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified"

               master, moreover, might well hesitate to correct a child in school if he was to meet
               sour looks and a poor supper at the end of the day. Sometimes female teachers, Mrs.
               Beavan said, paid for their board in some quiet home out of their cash salary, and
               gave up that which they could otherwise claim from the people.<note target="n6.72"

            <p TEIform="p">From these scattered glimpses of New Brunswick life at the middle of the
               last century, we arrive at the tentative conclusion that, culturally, society was
               largely uncultivated, but by no means everywhere content to be so. Here and there
               were little pockets, veins, and layers of spiritual soil either ripe for the planting
               of culture or already nourishing a modest growth. This means that in addition to the
               Lieutenant-Governors and enlightened reformers and legislators like Wilmot and Brown,
               besides interested parents like John Gregory, besides the clergy and the press, there
               were many people, less vocal and less in the public eye than these, who were anxious
               to see the status of teachers raised, the common schools improved, and the
               educational experiments and achievements of other countries given such trial as the
               province could afford to make. Supporters in the Assembly, as well as opponents of
               the school legislation of 1846, 1847, and 1852, had a backing therefore, in the
               province at large.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">The first of the legislative measures which resulted from the school
               inspections of 1845 and 1846 was in reference to the Grammar Schools. A number of
               interesting speculations occur to us when we consider why an act was passed relating
               to these schools before legislation was framed to establish a Normal School, and to
               improve the Parish Schools. First of all, there is the old suspicion that these
               schools had the support of powerful interests. The Church of England, by reason of an
               act amending the charter of King's College,<note target="n6.74" anchored="yes"
                  TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">74</hi>
               </note> was beginning to lose its control of that institution, but there is evidence
               that its grip was still strong on at least some of the Grammar Schools, even after
               the Act of 1846. We find that among the criticisms of the Grammar School at Saint
               John which were set forth in an Editorial in the Courier in 1852, the complaint was
               made that the constitution of the Board of Directors was unpopular, because it was
               too sectarian.<note target="n6.75" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">75</hi>
               </note> A few months before this, the Courier had published a letter from <q
                  rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">An Admirer of its Principles</q>,
               asking if the College and Grammar Schools were to remain as <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">class seminaries</q> for the benefit of a few,
               yet supported out of funds provided by the many. The writer went on to say that the
               Grammar Schools did not meet the wants of the Community, and, right or wrong, were
               regarded as <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">class schools, mere
                  appendages to the College at Fredericton, or designed to be such</q>. That they
               were under Episcopalian influence was all too apparent, said the critic. The letter
               concluded with the statement that if it was expected that parents of all
               denominations should support the Grammar Schools, then everything within and around
               them that savoured of sectarianism must be removed.<note target="n6.76"
                  anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">76</hi>
               </note> In view of these charges, it may be that Anglican and Family Compact
               influences turned the first attention of the Legislature to the Grammar Schools.
               There is a flaw in this argument, however, for when institutions operate in the
               interests of any group, that group naturally wishes them to remain as they are. It is
               possible, therefore, that the <pb n="108" id="p108" TEIform="pb"/> Grammar School Act
               of 1846 was sponsored by those persons who opposed Anglican and Family Compact
               influences, but if this were so, why was it that in 1852, six years after the Act,
               those influences were still strong enough to give rise to the complaints we have just
               noted? Perhaps the simplest explanation of the priority given to Grammar School
               legislation at this time lies in the fact that the recent inspection had revealed the
               woeful extent to which many of these schools were masquerading as secondary schools.
               When, therefore, at this same session James Brown introduced a measure for the
               establishment of a Normal School,<note target="n6.77" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">77</hi>
               </note> some of the members who helped to defeat it may have felt that the reform of
               the Grammar Schools should come first. Others may have found in legislation relating
               to the Grammar Schools an excuse for postponing the controversial question of a
               training school. Moreover, the session of 1846 was much occupied with railway
               legislation, the question of a retiring pension to Judge Botsford, and a discussion
               of the Lieutenant-Governor's action in expending money from the surplus civil list
               without the consent of the Legislature.<note target="n6.78" anchored="yes"
                  TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">78</hi>
               </note> Then, too, this was the last session of the existing House, so that members
               may have had an eye to the safety of their seats. Consequently, it was easier, and
               perhaps more expedient, to amend the Grammar Schools than to launch a plan which
               seemed costly and revolutionary to many people. Finally, resentment engendered
               against Lieutenant- Governor Colebrooke, because of his action in 1845 in appointing
               his English son-in-law, Alfred Reade, to the office of Provincial Secretary, may have
               again helped to postpone Colebrooke's cherished project, even although the Assembly
               was itself partly to blame for Colebrooke's mistake.<note target="n6.79"

               </note> One wonders if Gesner may not have had this whole episode in mind when he

                  and best pecuniary situations in the Colonies to persons from the Mother Country,
                  who are sent out to fill them. That this feeling has operated against education
                  there can be no doubt.</q>

               </note> This statement may not be very significant, for the feeling referred to may
               have been used as a mere excuse for educational backwardness resulting from other
               causes. If so, the excuse became invalid when Lord Stanley, after the Reade episode,
               conceded that public offices should be filled from among the natives or settled
               inhabitants of the Province.<note target="n6.81" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </note>
            </p>

            <p TEIform="p">The Act of 1846, in amendment of the laws in force relating to Grammar
               Schools, enacted that in every Grammar School there should be an average number of
               fifteen scholars over ten years of age in daily attendance, and that there should be
               taught, in addition to Orthography, Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, English Grammar,
               Geography, and English Composition, such advanced subjects as Ancient and Modern
               History, Natural History, Natural <pb n="109" id="p109" TEIform="pb"/> Philosophy,
               Mathematics, the use of globes, and the Latin and Greek languages. The teachers were
               to keep a register of the daily attendance and to make a return to the Trustees twice
               a year. The Trustees were to inspect the school at least every six months, and to
               incorporate in the teacher's report information about the teacher, the books and
               apparatus, the branches of education taught, the size and fitness of the building,
               the suitability of the furniture, the nature and extent of the religious instruction,
               the mode of discipline, the manner of teaching, and the general condition of the
               school. This report and the teacher's register were to be forwarded semi-annually to
               the Provincial Secretary for the information of the Government. If any school
               appeared deficient of the prescribed requirements, the Lieutenant-Governor, on the
               advice of his Council, might reduce the annual allowance to such Grammar School to a
               minimum of £ 50. This threat was significant as showing an assumption of supervision
               by an authority higher than the local Board of Directors, who, through incompetence
               or lack of interest, had allowed many of the Grammar Schools to fall far short of the
               responsibilities imposed on them by the Act of 1829.<note target="n6.82"
                  anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">82</hi>
               </note> Not until 1861, however, was this supervision strengthened further by placing
               the Grammar Schools under the Board of Education, while the Parish Schools were
               supervised by the Board of Education after 1847, and inspected by official inspectors
               after 1852. Thus until 1861 the Grammar Schools remained largely under local
               management and supervision.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">In the election of 1846 three vigorous proponents of political reform
               were elected, Wilmot, Fisher, and Ritchie, but on the whole the temper of the
               Legislature of 1847, in its opposition to drastic changes, differed little from that
               of the previous House.<note target="n6.83" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </note> The actual occasion of the remark was a discussion on intercolonial trade
               restrictions, but, taken out of its context, the observation is not devoid of general
               significance. However, although the Legislature was not yet ready to deal seriously
               with the assessment principle in relation to education, it could hardly evade any
               longer the subject of provision for teacher training, especially in the light of the
               report of 1845 and of the Lieutenant-Governor's warning that the country would suffer
               irretrievable loss, if timely provision were not made for the training of teachers
               and the regulation and inspection of Parish Schools.<note target="n6.85"

               </note> Moreover, it was obvious that the influx in 1846 and 1847 of large numbers of
               destitute and largely illiterate Irish immigrants had increased the task of education

               supported in the House by Wilmot and Brown.<note target="n6.86" anchored="yes"

               have noted that for some years previous to this act the doctrines of central
               supervision and pedagogic training had been advocated in New Brunswick, among those
               who were pressing for reforms, and we have observed the part played by
               Lieutenant-Governor Colebrooke in the circulation and popularization of the idea of a
               Normal School, but in our absorption with provincial affairs we have neglected to
               note the development of these principles in those wider fields from which influences
               gradually filtered, directly or indirectly, into New Brunswick.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">While here and there, mostly in Prussia, there were a few Teachers'
               Seminaries before the time of Pestalozzi, it was not until he had made his
               contribution that there was anything worth training teachers for, since children
               learned from books, often books in the form of a Catechism, and the teacher merely
               heard the memorized answers.<note target="n6.87" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">87</hi>
               </note> In various schools, and later at Yverdon, Pestalozzi drew about him other
               teachers interested in improving instruction, and his Institute became the first
               modern normal school.<note target="n6.88" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">88</hi>
               </note>
            </p>

            <p TEIform="p">We have seen that Prussian pedagogues had shown great enthusiasm for
               Pestalozzi's methods, and that the Prussian state, as part of a process of national
               regeneration, had created vernacular schools, had reorganized and redirected
               secondary education, had founded the University of Berlin, and had established a
               number of Teachers' Seminaries or Normal Schools. Other countries were slower in
               assuming state control, although in Revolutionary France the State definitely took
               over the control of education from the Church, and philosophers and enthusiasts
               formulated many plans to provide for the educational needs of the common people. In
               1802, that organizing genius, Napoleon, appointed a Director of Public Instruction to
               draw up an organizing law. This law made secondary and special education the function
               of the state, but left primary education to the communes to be provided as they saw
               fit, such primary schools as were established to be, however, under the supervision
               of the central authority. In 1810 a Superior Normal School began to offer a two-year
               course to graduates of the Lycées or secondary schools. During the Restoration period
               from 1815 to 1830, this system of public instruction continued almost unchanged,
               except that a number of elementary normal schools were created. In the reign of Louis
               Philippe, thinkers such as Thiers and Guizot turned their attention to the extension
               downward of the system of public instruction, and in 1831 Victor Cousin was sent to
               Prussia to study and report on the whole system of elementary education, teacher
               training, and administration, which had done so much for Prussia. On the basis of
               Cousin's report, the Law of 1833 made the maintenance of primary schools obligatory
               on every commune; provided for higher primary schools in towns and cities, additional
               normal schools, and a corps of Inspectors; and required of primary teachers normal
               training and state certification. This, in brief, was the state of educational
               organization in France in 1848<note target="n6.89" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               1870, while France was to experience 'reaction' in education, as well as in
               government, during that interval.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">Before we turn our attention to developments elsewhere, we should note
               two features of both the French and Prussian systems. First, although in both Prussia
               and France the state assumed a large degree of control and supervision of the common
               schools, it gave them little financial aid. In France the communes were responsible
               for these schools,<note target="n6.90" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">90</hi>
               </note> and in Germany, not until the twentieth century did the State contribute
               substantially to the expenses of public education.<note target="n6.91" anchored="yes"
                  TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">91</hi>
               </note> This was in contrast with New Brunswick, where the state gave comparatively
               generous aid long before it exercised supervision and control. Secondly, the
               democratic ideas of Revolutionary thinkers in France, and of liberal minded
               educational leaders in Prussia, failed to prevail against the influence of caste. In
               Germany, the Volksschules were designed to create an intelligent, patriotic, but
               obedient rank and file, while the other schools were for the official and directing
               class of society.<note target="n6.92" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">92</hi>
               </note> As for France, we are told that the system of primary education established
               by the Law of 1833 was intended to serve the needs of an inferior social and
               political class.<note target="n6.93" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">93</hi>
               </note> In both France and Germany there were but few transfer points from the
               schools for the masses to the schools for the leaders.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">England was influenced neither by the extreme nationalism which moved the
               German people nor by the romantic liberalism of French Revolutionary philosophers. It
               did have to yield, however, to the influences of the Industrial Revolution and the
               political changes which followed. After the Reform Bill of 1832, the state began to
               recognize the expediency of educating its masters, the people, but the question was:
                  <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">By what means?</q>
               Nonconformists and the advocates of a national system rejected the idea of Church
               control. On the other hand, state control and maintenance implied a secular system,
               and this all creeds rejected. Private munificence had helped in the spread of
               education, but, at best, it could be only a limited and precarious means of providing
               education on a national scale. Compromise was inevitable. The State gave aid, but
               distributed it through existing religious and philanthropic societies. In 1832 the
               Government appropriated £ 20,000 for grants to the National School Society and the
               British and Foreign School Society. In 1839, following the report of a Select
               Committee on Education, a Committee of the Privy Council on Education was created to
               superintend the application of grants. The President of this Council, Dr.
               Kay-Shuttleworth, wished to establish teacher-training Colleges where the religious
               instruction should be non-sectarian, but the National Society opposed this so
               bitterly that the Committee gave up the plan and distributed appropriations between
               the two great Societies, for the establishment of training colleges.<note
                  target="n6.94" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </note> These Societies had a number of training in- <pb n="112" id="p112"
                  TEIform="pb"/> stitutions already, as part of the system of monitorial instruction
               in which they specialized. When, however, the Committee of Council insisted on the
               right of inspecting the schools to which grants were given, and began to lay down the
               conditions on which aid should be granted, the thin edge of the wedge of state
               control was inserted.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">As the mechanical character of the monitorial system came to be
               recognized, Dr. Kay-Shuttleworth advocated as a substitute the pupil-teacher system
               of Holland. In 1846 a Minute of the Committee of Council made provision for a supply
               of pupil-teachers who were to be apprenticed to schoolmasters, and to be given
               special instruction over a long period by them. Each pupil-teacher was to receive a
               stipend, increasing with length of service, and each master a stated sum for each
               pupil instructed.<note target="n6.95" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

            </p>

            <p TEIform="p">In 1847 Lord Macaulay, defending in Parliament a Minute of the Committee
               of Council proposing the nationalization of education, declared that it was the duty
               of the state to provide for the education of the common people as an exercise of
               self-protection, and warned of dangers if progressive tendencies were not heeded. So
               strongly entrenched, however, was the voluntary system, and so little did the English
               people know or heed progress elsewhere that further action of significance had to
               wait until after the passage of the Reform Bill of 1867.<note target="n6.96"

            <p TEIform="p">When Colebrooke, as Governor of an English colony, applied to the Mother
               Country for assistance in the promotion of a Normal School, he was applying to a
               country which, as we have seen, had as yet no state system of education and no state
               normal schools. However, Dr. Kay-Shuttleworth, as we have noted, favored
               non-sectarian training schools. In 1844 when the Colonial Secretary referred to
               Kay-Shuttleworth some of Colebrooke's correspondence on the question of a training
               school, Kay-Shuttleworth wrote a letter, which, although containing no very profound
               opinions, was in definite encouragement of Colebrooke's idea.<note target="n6.97"
                  anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">97</hi>
               </note> Moreover, the Imperial Authorities were doubtless quite aware of the fact
               that in New Brunswick the question of a state normal school was not complicated as in
               England by the rivalries of strongly entrenched religious and educational societies.
               As far as can be seen, the Colonial Office and the Committee of the Privy Council
               seem to have been ready to co-operate in obtaining a headmaster for whatever kind of
               normal school the provincial authorities might see fit to establish, but not to the
               extent of paying part of the master's stipend. Colebrooke again, as in 1842,
               suggested that since so many immigrants from the United Kingdom would profit by the
               schools of New Brunswick, Her Majesty's Government might, until 1850, augment the
               grant of the New Brunswick Assembly in order that the services of a person of
               superior qualifications should be secured,<note target="n6.98" anchored="yes"

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">98</hi>
               </note> but this request, as before, went unheeded.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">From observations by Colebrooke and by the Inspectors in the report <pb
                  n="113" id="p113" TEIform="pb"/> of 1845, we may conclude that there were persons
               in New Brunswick who had some knowledge of educational developments in the United
               States. The problem of educational organization in America was not so much the
               harmonizing of Church schools and old educational foundations with a new state system
               as it was that of awakening interest in education and arousing willingness to pay for
                  it.<note target="n6.99" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </note> Without a Prussian monarch to impose a compulsory system for reasons of
               state, the idea of universal free education had to be evolved gradually, in a
               democratic manner, under the leadership of men and women with vision and
                  patience.<note target="n6.100" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">100</hi>
               </note> As in England, a number of semi-private philanthropic agencies, such as the
               Sunday Schools, the Lancastrian movement, and Infant School Societies, by founding
               schools helped to build up an interest in education. Gradually various political,
               social, and economic forces produced conditions which made state, rather than church,
               control and support of education desirable and expedient. The growth of manufacturing
               and of cities made the task of education too great for the home, the church, and
               philanthropic societies. Eventually, too, the spirit of the Declaration of
               Independence became partially realized in Jacksonian democracy, and resulted in full
               manhood suffrage in all the states. By 1825 democracy in the United States had
               arrived at a stage not reached in Britain until 1867. Public men, labor unions,
               Governors, began to urge the establishment of tax-supported schools. By 1850,
               non-sectarian, tax-supported, state directed common schools had become an actuality in
               almost every Northern State.<note target="n6.101" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

            <p TEIform="p">While we cannot concern ourselves here with the details of the struggle
               for this achievement, it is impossible to overlook the work of Horace Mann and Henry
               Barnard. The former, as Secretary of the first State Board of Education in
               Massachusetts (1837), annually organized a campaign to explain to people the
               importance of general education. It may be said that <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">he not only started a great common school revival
                  in Massachusetts which led to the regeneration of the schools there, but one which

                  did more than he to establish in the minds of the American people the conception
                  that education should be universal, non-sectarian, and free, and that its aim
                  should be social efficiency, civic virtue, and character, rather than mere

               school idea. The first state Normal School in the United States opened in
               Massachusetts in 1839. In a short time two others opened in the same state. Horace
               Mann's support of the Normal School idea had much to do with the success of these
               institutions. By 1860, there were eleven state and six private Normal Schools in
               eight of the American states. Closely related were the Teachers' Institutes organized
               by Henry Barnard in <pb n="114" id="p114" TEIform="pb"/> Connecticut in 1839 to offer

               those lines had been made with private funds. There was also the growth of interest

               interests of an exclusive Family Compact group. Dissenters, to escape the Anglican

               the support of schools in operation on a voluntary basis, and a system of teacher
               training definitely established. Everywhere Ryerson, like Horace Mann, was inspiring

            <p TEIform="p">The province of Nova Scotia resembled New Brunswick more than did any of
               the countries whose educational conditions we have briefly examined. In size the two
               provinces were nearly equal, and in geographical features and economic history there
               were many points of likeness. In Nova Scotia too, as in New Brunswick, the Anglican
               Church had attempted to control education, and <pb n="116" id="p116" TEIform="pb"/>
               the ruling classes favored the English system of private schools for the well-to-do
               and assisted schools for the poor. But Nova Scotia's population included two elements
               which, while not lacking in New Brunswick, in that province exercised much less
               influence. These were pre-Revolutionary New England stock and Scottish immigrants in
               sufficiently large numbers to stamp the life of the whole province. Perhaps for these
               reasons the champions of a public school system, who favored the education of rich
               and poor side by side <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">in true

               </note> obtained for the assessment principle an early place on the statute books, as
               we have already observed, and contrived to keep it there. However, since it was only
               permissive, its use was infrequent, and in 1832 there was a retreat when an enactment
               prohibited taxation for schools without the approval of the General Sessions of the
               Peace, and a two-thirds majority of the inhabitants of the local area.<note

               Scotland, Massachusetts, and Prussia, but, although recognizing the virtues of all of
               these, concluded that the people of Nova Scotia were not yet ready for compulsory
               assessment, free schools, and adequate teacher-training.<note target="n6.122"

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">122</hi>
               </note> In the hostility of the people of Nova Scotia to compulsory contributions for
               schools, and in the hesitancy of the Legislature, we find a marked resemblance to New
               Brunswick attitudes. Similarly, too, the teachers of Nova Scotia were poorly paid and
               often incompetent. Actually, progress in the two provinces proceeded at much the same
               rate. Nova Scotia achieved a Chief Superintendent in 1850, while New Brunswick
               established the same office in 1852. In the matter of a Normal School, New Brunswick
               was first, Nova Scotia not establishing such an institution until 1854. One possible
               explanation of this delay lies in the existence in Nova Scotia of a number of schools
               which served as partial substitutes for a provincial Normal School, or vied with each
               other for provincial aid in training teachers. Among these was an Academy at
               Boulardarie, opened in 1839 on the principles of the Glasgow Normal School by
               Alexander and Mrs. Munro, emissaries from that school. Not long afterwards, the
               management of the Royal Acadian School at Halifax petitioned the Assembly for aid to
               convert their school into a normal school, and the trustees of an Academy at New
               Glasgow likewise appealed to the Assembly for special aid. In 1845 the Central Board
               of Education recommended the conversion into a Normal School of the Royal Acadian
               School, since that institution was free of sectarian influence, and possessed a
               substantial building; but in 1847 a Committee of the Assembly reported adversely on
               the possibilities of making this school fit and suitable for the purpose. This
               Committee favored having a number of seminaries for training teachers, but the first
               Superintendent of Education, J. W. Dawson, after studying the schools of New York,
               New England, and Upper Canada, believed that an efficient Normal School, as in New
               York and Upper Canada, was preferable to several of inferior capabilities. <pb

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">124</hi>
               </note> so it was in New Brunswick. This province borrowed ideas and doctrines, texts
               and teachers; gathered inspiration and encouragement; and followed examples, from
               many sources. But everything was trimmed to fit the provincial purse and to conform
               to modest ideas of progress. In the last analysis, one has the impression that New
               Brunswick chose to institute central supervision and to establish a Normal School,
               not because the province was shaken by new ideas and was dedicated to progress, but
               because the practical problem of poor schools and poor teachers had to be solved
               somehow, and the experiences of other countries indicated that the advances mentioned
               might prove to be a solution of the problem in New Brunswick. It took many more years
               to convince the <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">slow moving
                  mass</q> of the people that the problem required a still more practical step in
               the form of general assessment for schools.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">The Board of Education which was instituted by the Act of 1847<note
                  target="n6.125" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">125</hi>
               </note> was such in name only, for it consisted of the Lieutenant-Governor and
               Executive Council, <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">the usual
                  arrangement in Tory Provinces</q>. There was a Secretary authorised at a salary of
               £ 100 a year, but no Chief Superintendent of Education or any equivalent, so that the
               Board lacked an agent wholly responsible for the advancement of education and capable
               of carrying out its policies. But at least the Act had created the form of a
               provincial educational body to which additions and improvements could be made.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">The Board was empowered to establish a Training School at Fredericton,
               the master of which was to be paid no more than £ 200 a year. A Model School was to
               be attached to the Training School so that teachers in training might demonstrate
               their ability to teach. If the Board thought it expedient, subsidiary training
               schools might be set up at other points in the Province, where teachers trained at
               the Central Training School might teach other teachers and approved candidates.
               Students in training, after they had demonstrated their ability to teach, were to
               receive an allowance of ten shillings a week for the ten weeks of their training.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">The framers of the Act evidently planned that teachers already licensed
               must be given the first opportunity of profiting by the Training School, for the
               Board could require as many licensed teachers to attend as it thought necessary. One
               can see reasons for this, especially in the light of the Inspection of 1845, but one
               can also see some of the disadvantages. In the first place, there was the difficulty
               of inducing veteran teachers to think fresh thoughts and to change their settled
               ways. Secondly, there was the resentment which many of these would feel at having to
               lose a term's teaching, journey to Fredericton, and be taught by a stranger, whose
               length of teaching service was less than their own and had been gained in a foreign
               country. <pb n="118" id="p118" TEIform="pb"/> The master of the Training School was
               to train those who attended in the Art of Teaching, which was to include a thorough
               knowledge of communicating the rudiments and elementary branches of common school
               education, in a manner best suited to the capacities, ages, and conditions of the
               children of the Province. That the short space of ten weeks was deemed sufficient
               time which to do this indicates that the legislators of 1847 either had an eye to
               economy, or understood the art of pedagogy very imperfectly. In all probability both
               of these speculations are true, but there was in addition a practical reason for the
               length of the training course. Since the school year at that time consisted of four
               terms of ten or twelve weeks, a teacher could attend the Training School at the loss
               of only one term from his school.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">In order to compel attendance at the Training School it was enacted that
               licenses should be issued only to teachers who had attended the institution, but the
               Board of Education could say when this clause should go into effect. As a matter of
               fact, an amendment in 1849 yielded ground on this point by providing that the Board
               of Education might grant licenses of the lowest grade to female teachers, in certain
               cases, without requiring them to attend the Training School, and further, might
               license untrained teachers in areas remote from the Training School. This concession.
               was the first of a number of regrettable compromises in respect to teachers' licenses
               which various conditions have necessitated in New Brunswick from time to time.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">According to the Act of 1847 licensed teachers were to be classified in
               three divisions, based, one concludes, on knowledge rather than teaching ability.
               Teachers of the lowest class were to teach Spelling, Reading, Writing, and Simple
               Arithmetic; second class teachers, in addition to those subjects, were to teach
               English Grammar, Geography, and Book-keeping; and for teachers of the highest class
               further additions were Natural Philosophy,<note target="n6.126" anchored="yes"
                  TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">126</hi>
               </note> Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Mensuration, Land Surveying, and Navigation.
               We are struck by the absence of History from the curriculum, and by the inclusion of
               Surveying and Navigation as an indication of the importance of lumbering and shipping
               in the provincial economy. In reality, the lofty requirements demanded by first class
               teachers seem to have been on paper only at first. We find in a Minute of the Board
               of Education, under the date of May 30, 1848, an admission that the Board was acting
               on the assumption that the entire qualifications required by the Act could not, at
               the time, be demanded without refusing first class certificates to all candidates.
               Under these circumstances, the Board had adopted the principle of granting first
               class certificates only in cases in which the certificate as to competency in
               teaching was satisfactory, and the teacher possessed knowledge in some one of the
               extra branches required from the first class of teachers.<note target="n6.127"
                  anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">127</hi>
               </note> This discrepancy between theory and practice may have been one of the reasons
               why the first Principal of the Normal School so strongly <pb n="119" id="p119"
                  TEIform="pb"/> advocated lower standards in theory, and a closer approximation in
               practice to the selected standards. Legislative grants to teachers of the three ranks
               were set at £ 30, £ 22, and £ 18 a year respectively, in contrast with the £ 20 a
               year which was granted to all teachers previous to the passage of this Act. However,
               the sum to be paid to the teacher by the inhabitants of a district was to be the same
               as before, £ 20 a year; was to be raised by subscription, and could be paid in board
               and lodging if desired&#8212;a provision which would counteract considerably the
               tendency of the Training School to elevate the profession.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">The Act of 1847 continued the arrangement of the Parish Trustees, who, as
               earlier, were charged with a good deal of responsibility and authority. The Justices
               of the Peace were to be continued as the link between the schools of the Parish and
               the Provincial Secretary. There were the usual provisions regarding poor scholars and
               maximum grants to parishes and counties. Aside from those sections of the Act which
               related to the Board of Education and the Training School, the most interesting
               section is that which authorized the Board of Education to spend £ 1000 for the
               purpose of providing books and apparatus for the use of the Parish Schools.
               Investigating this subject of school texts, we find that the Inspectors of the
               Grammar Schools had stated in their report to the Assembly in 1846 that they had
               before them a series of School Books, prepared and published under the
               superintendence of the National Board of Education for Ireland. The Inspectors
               described these books as being of superior character and well suited to the needs of
               New Brunswick, and recommended that enquiry be made during recess as to the cheapest
               mode of obtaining a supply for the Province, whether by importation from Ireland or
               Canada, or by republication in New Brunswick.<note target="n6.128" anchored="yes"

               </note> We next learn that in 1847 Colebrooke sent Grey a resolution of the Executive
               Council expressive of a desire to obtain a selection of approved Parish School Books
               through the medium of the Committee on Education of the Privy Council. Later in the
               year Grey wrote that the books were on their way, and enclosed a letter from the

               </note> When we enquire into this availability of Irish texts, we discover that a
               degree of progress, impossible at the time in England, had occurred in Ireland in the
               direction of a national system. In 1831, following a period of reports and
               commissions, an organized system under one head was announced, with a common
               curriculum as far as possible without proselytism. The central authority was to be a
               Board of Commissioners, appointed by the Crown, who were to maintain a register of
               qualified teachers, establish Model and Training Schools, provide for the regular
               inspection of schools under its control, and distribute the annual parliamentary
               grants. The religious problem presented difficulties, but eventually both the
               Protestant and Catholic Churches accepted the National System. Later, Catholic fear
               of Protestant proselytism <pb n="120" id="p120" TEIform="pb"/> led to the
               introduction of separate religious instruction during school hours in districts
               exclusively Catholic, and the National Schools became to a large extent
                  denominational.<note target="n6.130" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">130</hi>
               </note> This development, however, had not yet occurred at the time in which we are
               here interested. What we wish to note particularly is the effort of the National
               Board to solve the text-book problem, which, in 1830, was much the same as in New
               Brunswick. For a reading lesson one child might use the Bible, another the adventures
               of a highwayman, a third a 'loose' romance. The Board approved such books in use as
               it deemed worthy, and edited and printed others. These latter were distributed gratis
               or at half price, and with the assistance of the Inspectors were gradually introduced
               into the National Schools. They were uniform in character and well graded, and
               contained nothing inimical to Christianity, morality, and patriotism. <q
                  rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">Their excellence found them ready

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">131</hi>
               </note> These, then, were the books which were Ireland's gift to New Brunswick,
               figuratively speaking, at the very time when the province was providing a home for
               thousands of Irish refugees.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">To implement the Act of 1847 the Board of Education had to make provision
               for a building and a master, as well as for books. The old stone gaol was fitted up
               as a home for the master, and a school house was erected within the same
                  enclosure.<note target="n7.1" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">1</hi>
               </note> Once again Governor Colebrooke corresponded with the Colonial Secretary on
               the subject of a qualified master. After some correspondence expressing doubt that a
               competent teacher could be induced to come for £ 200, Grey recommended Marshall
               d'Avray, who, as Director of a Normal School in Mauritius, was in receipt of double
               the sum voted by the New Brunswick Legislature, together with house rent and fees
               from private teaching. But since the climate was prejudicial to the health of his
               family, d'Avray was willing to come to New Brunswick if he could do so <q
                  rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">without loss either of station or
                  of emolument</q>. To defray expenses of passage and of providing clothing suitable
               for a northern climate, d'Avray, the Colonial Secretary said, asked for £ 300,
               one-third of which he would be willing to repay by monthly instalments should the
               Colonial Legislature exact it. Grey concluded the letter by saying that it would be
               difficult to find a person so well qualified as d'Avray who would accept the position
               at such a moderate scale of remuneration. Colebrooke's reply admitted the smallness
               of the salary, and expressed the hope that when the Normal School had been
               established and was appreciated, the salary might be augmented. Fifty pounds was
               already sanctioned for travelling expenses, and Colebrooke asked His Lordship to
               sanction an advance to d'Avray from the surplus Civil List Fund, if the advance
               should not be reimbursed by the Assembly.<note target="n7.2" anchored="yes"

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">2</hi>
               </note> One fancies that Colebrooke may have chafed at the necessity of haggling over
               terms. Yet although economy was the cry during those years, large sums were often
               unwisely spent for less worthy purposes than the secure establishment of a Normal
               School. For instance, in 1850 the same Assembly that had passed the Act of 1847
               setting £ 200 as the maximum salary of the master of the Training School granted
               Lieutenant-Colonel Brown of the First Royal Regiment practically the same sum (£
               198), for duties paid by him on liquor consumed by the regiment during the year.<note

               </note> For the same session the postage charges of some of the members amounted to £
               17; and £ 8 15s. was paid for propping up a bush which had blown down in the
               Government House gardens.<note target="n7.4" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

            <p TEIform="p">At this point in the history of New Brunswick's first Normal School our
               attention focuses on the man whose responsibility it was to initiate the <pb n="122"
                  id="p122" TEIform="pb"/> operations of the school. His background and education,
               his ideas and experiences, the limitations and difficulties which conditioned his
               work, all assume significance because of his position.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">Joseph Marshall de Brett, second Baron d'Avray, was the eldest son of Dr.
               Joseph Head Marshall, an extraordinary Englishman who assisted Edward Jenner in the
               discovery of vaccination. His experiences included vaccinating a large part of the
               British Mediterranean fleet, introducing vaccination for the first time into Italy
               and other Mediterranean countries, popularizing it at the Neapolitan court and
               becoming Physician Extraordinary to the King of Naples. Subsequently he abandoned
               medicine for politics, warned the French government of the impending return of
               Napoleon from Elba, and became deeply concerned in the secret diplomacy involved in
               the overthrow of the Napoleonic empire, receiving the title of Baron d'Avray,<note
                  target="n7.5" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">5</hi>
               </note> a title which was afterwards confirmed by Louis XVIII. His eldest son, who
               commonly used the name Marshall d'Avray, spent his early childhood in France and his
               young manhood in England. Because of services rendered by Dr. Marshall to Britain in
               the matter of negotiations with the King of Naples and Louis XVIII, the British
               authorities may possibly have recognized an obligation to find situations for his
               children when he himself was dead and family fortunes had declined.<note
                  target="n7.6" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">6</hi>
               </note> This may explain why Grey, in recommending d'Avray to Lieutenant-Governor
               Colebrooke designated him as Director of a Normal School in Mauritius, when actually
               d'Avray had held no such position. Of this fact Grey was aware, as two months earlier
               he had received a letter from d'Avray reviewing the circumstances under which the
               latter had gone to Mauritius and had returned. From this letter<note target="n7.7"
                  anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">7</hi>
               </note> we learn that His Majesty's Government had intended to establish a Normal
               School in the Island of Mauritius, and d'Avray had gone there as Director, having
               made preparation by attending the Normal Training School at Battersea, probably one
               maintained by the National Society, since d'Avray was an Anglican. On his arrival in
               Mauritius he found that the Colonial Government did not think it possible to
               establish a Normal School on the plan proposed in England, and he was therefore
               forced to engage in a number of activities, such as inspecting the Government Free
               Schools, drawing up reports, teaching in the Preparatory School of the Royal College,
               and substituting for professors in the College. Eventually he took charge of the
               Elementary Classes of the College, which seems to have been more of a secondary
               school than a university. Here his efforts met with great success,<note target="n7.8"
                  anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">8</hi>
               </note> but living was high in Mauritius and he was never entirely free from
               financial worries. When he returned to England because of the illness of his wife, he
               was in debt to the Mauritius Government for advances in salary, and anxious to obtain
               almost any position. In September, 1847, he asked for the post of Inspector of
               Schools in British Guiana, a posi- <pb n="123" id="p123" TEIform="pb"/> tion
               affording a salary of £ 500 and £ 200 travelling expenses, but Grey refused to accede
               to the request, saying that if the climate of Mauritius did not suit d'Avray, neither
               would that of British Guiana.<note target="n7.9" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">9</hi>
               </note> A month later the position in New Brunswick was available. Although even in
               England the post could hardly have seemed a sinecure, d'Avray accepted, and early in
               1848, with his wife and daughter, arrived in New Brunswick, where his communication
               with the members of the Legislature, then in session, made a favourable
                  impression.<note target="n7.10" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">10</hi>
               </note>
            </p>


            <p TEIform="p">The nature of Marshall d'Avray's ideas on education is significant, for
               if his ideas were carried out, they were an influence in the development of education
               in New Brunswick, and if they were ignored or rejected, they become a foil for those
               ideas which were preferred to his. d'Avray had to struggle with varied and nagging
               practical problems in the midst of strange people and unfamiliar surroundings, and
               within the framework of arrangements made before his arrival. A number of his
               reports, lectures, and plans abound in practical details, from which it is difficult
               to distil his philosophy, but fortunately two printed lectures are available in which
               he dealt with education generally. From these we may conclude that he held views
               which, in intelligence and vision, were far in advance of his time, and may even be
               regarded as ultra-progressive in certain quarters today. The second of these lectures
               was delivered two years after the first. One cannot read both without feeling that in
               the interval d'Avray had applied himself seriously to thinking about the educational
               needs of the provincial society in which he found himself, had come to a clearer
               realization of how those needs might be met, and had dared to cut away from what
               Parrington calls <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">the drab realisms
                  of a cautious past</q>.<note target="n7.11" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">11</hi>
               </note> One would not like to say that he had adopted any new theories not held prior
               to his arrival in the province, but one does feel that he had got a fresh perspective
               and had learned to see new meaning in European theories and ideas, as applicable to
               the colonial society and the educational problem with which he had to cope.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">The first of these lectures was given on February 10, 1848. Since the
               occasion was the opening of the Normal School, d'Avray naturally stressed the
               importance of proper teaching, explained the function of the Model School in the
               acquisition of the art, and endeavored to inspire in teachers a sense of the dignity
               and responsibility of their profession. He reminded them of the part which repetition
               and practice play in the retention of what is learned, and warned teachers that their
               business was to teach so as to exercise the original faculties of their pupils'
               minds, (a timely warning in view of what the Inspectors of 1844 had observed). But
               d'Avray's address contained matter of greater significance than this. In his audience
               that day there may have been those who wondered if this gentleman of title and urbane
               manners had brought with him the English notions of class distinctions, and if he
               regarded the Parish Schools of New Brunswick with condescension, as schools for
               colonials of a static lower <pb n="124" id="p124" TEIform="pb"/> order. Although one
               gentleman did ascribe these attitudes to d'Avray, as we shall see later, the tone of
               d'Avray's remarks on this occasion calls for a more liberal interpretation. His
               audience that day almost certainly included Wilmot and Fisher, men who had been born
               outside the charmed circle of provincial wealth and aristocracy,<note target="n7.12"
                  anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">12</hi>
               </note> but who had become leaders of eminence. Whether d'Avray knew this or not, and
               whatever the beliefs on which he had been nurtured, he seemed aware that he had come
               to a land where humble birth presented no insuperable social barrier to talent,
               ability, and ambition. He did, however, advocate restricting the curriculum of the
               Parish Schools to Reading, Writing, Orthography, Arithmetic, Grammar, and Geography,
               since the majority of the pupils in those schools were not likely to devote a long
               time to schooling, and therefore should be taught really useful knowledge during the
               short time they remained under tuition.<note target="n7.13" anchored="yes"
                  TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">13</hi>
               </note> His intimate conviction was, he said, that such a limited scale of
               instruction was the best adapted to the present urgent wants of the community.<note
                  target="n7.14" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">14</hi>
               </note> Possibly he made a mistake when he said that <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">mere theorists</q> in education might think he
               had adopted too narrow a scale, for this jibe may have initiated the personal
               antagonism of John Gregory. Perhaps, too, it was tactless to justify a limited
               curriculum for the Parish Schools of New Brunswick by asking how few laboring men in
               England could answer a simple question in Arithmetic, Grammar or Geography, could
               read their Bibles or scrawl their names, for this comparison may have seemed to imply
               that the inhabitants of New Brunswick were on a level with the not yet emancipated
               laboring classes of England. But d'Avray was careful to explain that he did not mean
               that, for he asked: <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">And shall we be

               </note> Moreover, in speaking of the indifference of parents to education he said
               that this indifference was to be wondered at when we remember <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">that in this country, the blessings of Education

                  natural talents be such as to enable him to profit by the opportunities which are

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">16</hi>
               </note> Furthermore, although d'Avray insisted on the function of the Parish School
               to impart that sort of instruction which would be of daily service to children
               through life <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">in their present
                  sphere</q>, he added that such instruction was the stepping stone to the
               acquisition of further instruction whenever their inclinations prompted them to seek
               it, or their circumstances enabled them to do so.<note target="n7.17" anchored="yes"

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">17</hi>
               </note> These quotations seem to predicate the existence of a belief in education as
               the birthright of all, satisfaction at the absence of social barriers in New
               Brunswick, and an appreciation of the eco- <pb n="125" id="p125" TEIform="pb"/> nomic
               factor as the real drawback to educational progress. But d'Avray went further than
               this. He seems to have been the first person in New Brunswick to outline publicly a
               plan by which ambitious but poor children could obtain an advanced education. Living
               in an age which lacked good roads, motor vehicles, Gestetner machines, and quick mail
               service, he could not visualize the taking of secondary education to rural areas by
               means of regional high schools and correspondence courses, but he offered a modest
               scheme whereby bright country children might be sent to the high school. He admitted
               that to do this would involve expense, but declared that the comparatively trifling
               addition would increase one hundred fold the efficacy of the sums already applied to
               educational purposes. In his own words, the plan was that <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">of fostering superior talent, wherever it may be
                  found among the juvenile population, by opening for it a path from the lowest to
                  the highest of our Educational Establishments, by means of exhibitions
                  (scholarships) from schools of one grade to those of a higher</q>. He proposed
               that each Grammar School be endowed with two exhibitions for two years, to be
               competed for by candidates from the Parish Schools of the County, such competitions
               to take place at each yearly visit of a General School Inspector. Further, he
               suggested that four other exhibitions for three years be attached to the High Schools
               of the Province, namely, one each to the Collegiate School at Fredericton, the
               Grammar School at Saint John, the Wesleyan Academy at Sackville, and the Baptist
               Seminary at Fredericton, to be competed for by candidates from the various county
               Grammar Schools. To crown the scheme he proposed an additional exhibition of three
               years duration at King's College. Thus <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified"
                  TEIform="q">a clear way would be thrown open to the humblest individual, possessed
                  of the requisite talents, to attain the highest literary eminence in the

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">18</hi>
               </note> After noting the stimulating effects of this scheme on teachers, parents and
               pupils, d'Avray concluded the exposition of his plan with a burst of oratory,
               declaring that the blessings of Education, <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified"
                  TEIform="q">which formerly fell to the share of a few would be placed within reach
                  of all who chose to seek them. The Gates of the Temple of Knowledge which once
                  opened with difficulty to the studious but favored Scholar, would be thrown back
                  wide open upon their hinges that all might enter, and the waters of the Fountain
                  of Wisdom, of which in other days a few pale students alone were seen to sip,
                  would now be quaffed in deep draughts by any and all who thirsted for
                  them</q>.<note target="n7.19" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

            </p>


            <p TEIform="p">d'Avray's scheme may be open to the modern criticism which has been
               directed against Thomas Jefferson's not dissimilar plan for Virginia in the
               eighteenth century, namely, that although it aimed to open the cultural riches of
               civilization to all, only a very few could profit,<note target="n7.20" anchored="yes"
                  TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">20</hi>
               </note> but if d'Avray's plan proved to be unacceptable, it was probably not because
               it was too narrow, but rather because it was too liberal. In this connection it
               should be borne in mind that <pb n="126" id="p126" TEIform="pb"/> before his training
               at the Battersea normal school, d'Avray had been educated by his father who is said
               to have tutored the children of the liberal monarch, King Louis Philippe, and who
               according to the testimony of the Countess de Boigne and others, as interpreted by
               Joseph Conrad in his novel, The Suspect, was by no means unsympathetic to the
               democratic principles of the French Revolution. However, d'Avray could hardly have
               realized how novel, expensive, and therefore impracticable, his proposed plan would
               appear. It is likely that no one took it seriously, for there seems to have been no
               comment, and certainly it was not tried. One wonders what New Brunswick talent might
               have been salvaged if the scheme had been recognized as workable.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">Two years later he delivered another lecture in the Temperance Hall at
               Fredericton, on January 22, 1850, which was afterwards printed at the request of the
               teachers of the district. In it he declared that the term education was often
               misapplied, since it did not signify that preparation for the actual business of life
               which ought to be the aim of all Education. As the result of his own experience and
               personal observation, he asserted that what was termed a first rate education in
               England was singularly ill-calculated to fit a young man for his future career. In
               asserting this he would not be biased, he said, by his early feelings and
               impressions, or by the certainty that he would be opposed by hundreds, who would
               argue in favor of the system of Classical Education <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">whose strongest claim to their sympathy and
                  admiration arises from its venerable antiquity, and from the fact that despite its

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">21</hi>
               </note> Although acknowledging the value of the study of the dead languages in
               exercising the mental faculties and cultivating the perceptions, d'Avray anticipated
               modern educational theory by denying that such study was the only means of producing
               so desirable a result, and appealed to former classical scholars to confess that the
               Latin and Greek, which they had acquired at the cost of many years of painful work,
               was rarely of any service to them. He declared that the Universities themselves were
               tacitly admitting that for centuries they had been wrong, and were enlarging their
               course of studies to include those sciences which ought never to have been neglected.
               He then asked this long and searching question&#8212;if in the Old Country a new
               conception of education was emerging, if in that wealthy land men were concluding
               that Education should be so conducted as to qualify the rising generation for the
               skilful discharge of the duties of life, if the learned heads of the British
               Universities were becoming convinced <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified"
                  TEIform="q">that they can no longer lag behind in the onward march of improvement,
                  that they also must keep pace with the spirit of the times, and provide some
                  better and more nourishing food than the romantic lore upon which they had fed so
                  long; that they must endeavor now to make them practically useful men and not
                  merely learned pedants-, if England, the land of dearly cherished prejudices is
                  doing this, how clearly it is our duty in this favored Province, where all may
                  find the means of a comfortable existence who choose to labour for it, but where
                  all or nearly all must labour to obtain those means; how imperatively are we <pb

                  them for the business of after life, qualify them for intercourse with their
                  fellowmen, and for the efficient and conscientious discharge of every

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">22</hi>
               </note> In brief, d'Avray called for an educational system that would pay practical,
               social, and civic dividends, and challenged the people of the Province to demand it,
               declaring that the Government could not alone produce the desired benefit. <q

            <p TEIform="p">He then described the educational institutions of England and showed that
               the private and proprietary schools for the middle classes, while superior to those
               for the upper classes, were still defective, affording their pupils but scanty
               training for the business of earning a livelihood.<note target="n7.24" anchored="yes"

               </note> He next described the schools for the poor&#8212;Pauper Schools, Infant Schools,
               Monitorial Schools, Sunday Schools, and Schools of Industry,<note target="n7.25"
                  anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">25</hi>
               </note> drawing particular attention to the type mentioned last, because in those
               schools manual work, such as Shoemaking, Tailoring and Farming was combined with
               ordinary school subjects. In this connection, he referred to schools on the
               Continent, particularly the School and Model Farm near Berne founded by DeFellenberg,
               a Swiss associate and follower of Pestalozzi. While New Brunswick, by the bounty of
               Providence, did not need institutions for the education of paupers, d'Avray thought
               that from the example of such schools the Province might learn something of value. He
               proposed, therefore, the formation of at least one Agricultural School or College to
               which should be attached a Model Farm, where all the improvements of modern science
               could be applied to the tillage of the soil and to the cultivation of the best breeds
               of stock. There should be workshops also, where the students might acquire skill in
               the use of carpenter's tools and in the construction and repair of farm implements.
               He would have the Arithmetic course include lessons on keeping farm accounts,
               surveying fields, and measuring timber, hay, and manure. Lectures in Botany,
               Agricultural Chemistry, Mechanics, Anatomy, and the care of animals should supplement
               the ordinary school subjects of Reading, Writing, Geography, History, and
               Composition. <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">Such is the plan upon
                  which it is my firm belief,</q> said d'Avray, <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">that Education can best be conducted in this
                  Young Province . . . . Then would the Province of New Brunswick, finding in its
                  own bosom enough and more than enough to supply its wants, cease to be dependent
                  as it is now upon other States for the chief articles of consumption, and rapidly
                  rise to that enviable position which must naturally <pb n="128" id="p128"
                     TEIform="pb"/> result from the well directed energy of its inhabitants.</q> As
               for the cost, he thought that after the original outlay, under proper management the
               annual expenses of such an establishment would be very small, and might even be
               covered by the produce.<note target="n7.26" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">26</hi>
               </note>
            </p>

            <p TEIform="p">In conjunction with this Agricultural School, d'Avray said he would
               operate the Training School, which Parish School teachers would be required to attend
               for at least six months, and where they would take part in the exercises of the
               School and in all the occupations of the Farm and Work Shop. Since Algebra and
               Navigation were not in very general demand in the backwoods, let those who wished to
               acquire such subjects do so at the Grammar Schools. Of these he said he knew little,
               as no facilities had been afforded him of observing the mode in which they were
               conducted, but if they resembled the Collegiate School, with which he was acquainted,
               then they were well calculated to meet the exigencies of the scholar. He fervently
               hoped that the Collegiate School might long flourish at the head of the Grammar
               Schools of New Brunswick, and resist the attacks of ignorance and malignity<note
                  target="n7.27" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">27</hi>
               </note>&#8212;a reference, doubtless, to d'Avray's avowed enemy, John Gregory, who had
               previously become involved in a violent and dramatic quarrel with George Roberts, the
               master of the Collegiate School, and the grandfather of Sir Charles G. D.
               Roberts.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">d'Avray then addressed the teachers of the Province, who were, he said,
               in many respects to blame for much of the evil complained of in connection with the
               Parish Schools. He urged them to put away petty feeling and jealousy, to form
               Teachers' Associations, and above all to study diligently that they might become
               efficient instructors and elevate the standing of their profession. Finally, he hoped
               that his lecture might excite some interest in those who were in a position to give
               effect to his recommendations, and that such persons might be induced to acknowledge
               that education, to operate beneficially, must take a more practical direction than it
               had hitherto done.<note target="n7.28" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">28</hi>
               </note>
            </p>

            <p TEIform="p">What were the effects of this speech? We know that many who heard it were
               enthusiastic, for it was in response to their solicitations that the lecture was
               printed. But when a new school act was passed in 1852 it embodied none of d'Avray's
               principles except two incidentals, inspection and optional assessment for schools,
               both features which had been urged in the Province before d'Avray came. Nearly ninety
               years had to pass before steps were taken to give to the education of rural children
               in New Brunswick that practical direction which he recommended, and a Provincial
               Agricultural School has never been realized. It is true that during the decade
               following this lecture a renewed and determined effort was made to convert King's
               College into an Agricultural School. It is also true that d'Avray opposed this
               proposal. It is evident that, in spite of his emphasis on vocational training, he
               never belittled the importance of classical education, although he stated in 1871
               that many traditional and inherited opinions, such as the idea that Greek and Latin
               versification were the <pb n="129" id="p129" TEIform="pb"/> only ends of any system
               of education, were gradually being exploded as fallacious, and unsuited to the
               requirements of the age.<note target="n7.29" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">29</hi>
               </note> We must also bear in mind that at no time did he advocate the closing of the
               Grammar Schools or King's College, and the abolition of classical instruction. He
               merely called attention to the unreasonableness of the sole emphasis on such
               learning.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">So far, we have examined only that evidence which seems to support the
               theory that d'Avray held liberal views in education. The fact that one of his
               contemporaries accused him of social bias requires an equally careful examination.
               The cause of the bad feeling between d'Avray and John Gregory is not certain. The
               personal reaction of each to the other may have been one of those natural antagonisms
               that occasionally spring up inexplicably between two strong personalities. On the
               other hand, Gregory, as Secretary of the Board of Education, and possessor of
               positive views, which he was accustomed to express freely, may have resented
               d'Avray's calm assumption that he, d'Avray, was the educational authority of New
               Brunswick. Moreover, Gregory, on his own word, was of the people and for the people,
               and seems to have found reason to suspect d'Avray of patrician sympathies. Whatever
               the cause, the battle seems to have commenced almost immediately after d'Avray's
               arrival in New Brunswick. d'Avray's reference to educational theorists, in his
               opening lecture, was evidently meant to include Gregory, for later d'Avray spoke of
               the disinclination of the Board of Education to accept and sanction any alterations
               or improvements <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">not emanating from
                  themselves</q>. <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">None of them, he

                  they are, I believe, disposed to receive any new suggestions with considerable
                  jealousy.</q>

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">30</hi>
               </note> In reply, Gregory criticized the tone of d'Avray's first report, and said
               that the designation which d'Avray had made of the Act of 1847 as an absurdity and an
               impossibility was a discourtesy to the Legislature and Council. The Act might not be
               perfect, but it would be neither an absurdity nor an impossibility in the hands of
               those who were <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">competent and
                  disposed to carry out its provisions without being prematurely desirous of
                  altering its principles and of opposing their own isolated views against the good
                  sense of the Legislature, and the decisions of the Lieutenant Governor in
                  Council</q>. If, said Gregory, d'Avray had a correct conception of the difference
               between a Crown Colony and one having a representative form of Government, he would
               be able to see more clearly how the law was to be carried out.<note target="n7.31"

               direction of E. H. Duval, Gregory, in his official report as Secretary to the Board

               d'Avray, who was then the Superintendent of Education, of actions which had placed
               Gregory in a false light, and had referred to d'Avray with considerable asperity in

               </note> In a number of philippics in the form of letters to the press Gregory
               attacked afresh d'Avray's views on education, thereby elevating the question from a
               clash of personalities to a conflict between opposing educational philosophies, a
               conflict in which Gregory chose to regard himself as the champion of democratic
               education and d'Avray as its opponent.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">Immediately after d'Avray's initial advocacy of a restricted curriculum
               for Parish Schools, Gregory had claimed that to insist on a limited curriculum was to
               say, in fact, that the greater number of Provincial youths should receive no further
               school instruction than Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, Grammar, and Geography, and
               declared that <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">this would be a
                  social mistake and a serious political blunder</q>.<note target="n7.35"
                  anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">35</hi>
               </note> In 1854 Gregory spoke still more strongly. He declared that d'Avray's
               educational policy and not parental apathy and indifference was the real stumbling
               block to educational progress. When in 1848 d'Avray had reduced the course at the
               Normal School to less than what His Majesty's ministers had proposed for the
               emancipated negroes of the West Indies, all were struck dumb with amazement at
               d'Avray's bold pretensions. The limited course of instruction proposed by him might
               do for remote and poor districts, but it left no alternative to boys in towns and
               wealthy farming districts but that of wasting their time in vain repetitions, or
               removing to the Grammar Schools at an expense their friends could ill afford. Indeed,
               said Gregory, reflection on d'Avray's career in this province <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">and particularly on his evident anxiety to
                  restrain popular education convinces me that his own early education has been very
                  defective, and that while acquiring a knowledge of French, to which he is so much
                  indebted, he has imbibed the political opinions of the French noblesse in the
                  anti-Revolutionary times</q>.<note target="n7.36" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">36</hi>
               </note> In his next letter to the press Gregory admitted that there was parental
               apathy in the Province, but said that it was due to the indifferent character of the
               schools and the little work that they accomplished. This in turn was due to d'Avray's
               promotion of a <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">subordinating system
                  for the scholars who pursue only the English branches</q>. Gregory claimed that
               d'Avray, in urging the propriety of lessening the course of study for the <pb n="131"
                  id="p131" TEIform="pb"/> English scholar (as opposed to the classical scholar) was
               motivated, not by practical considerations, but by class feeling. Gentlemen study the
               classics; the mere English scholar never can be a gentleman; he is down and ought to
               be kept so. Such, said Gregory, was the master spirit which controlled education in
               the Province, and until a better spirit was infused it was libelous to charge the
               inefficiency of the schools to the apathy of the people at large.<note target="n7.37"

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">37</hi>
               </note> Nearly three years later Gregory was still writing in the same strain. He
               spoke of the vast social and political interests which were involved in the depths of
               the educational question, and appealed to Her Majesty's Government for protection
               against the obloquy to which he had been subjected, concluding: <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">I have yet to be convinced that it is a principle
                  of the British Government that he who dares to interfere, even legitimately and
                  officially with the educational question, in any way tending to the amelioration
                  of the system as regards the comparatively poor, is deemed worthy of being
                  degraded and wronged.</q>
               <note target="n7.38" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">38</hi>
               </note>
            </p>

            <p TEIform="p">Impetuous and officious as Gregory seems to have been, in these
               observations there are indications of a sincere interest in education. It seems a
               pity that he and d'Avray could not have worked together for the cause of education!
               Yet it is possible that their viewpoints were so diametrically opposite that teamwork
               was out of the question. This quarrel between John Gregory and Baron d'Avray may have
               reflected the elements of a social conflict. Gregory, who knew d'Avray personally and
               had opportunities of hearing him express his views in ordinary conversation, seems to
               have been convinced of d'Avray's Tory principles. We are bound to consider, of
               course, the possibility that Gregory's personal bias detracts from the reliability of
               his testimony. We note, too, that Gregory, in criticizing d'Avray's limited aims for
               Parish Schools, chose to ignore d'Avray's suggestion of scholarships leading from
               Parish Schools to King's College. On the other hand, d'Avray seems to have continued
               to insist on a restricted programme of instruction for Parish Schools after it may
               have been evident that there was no likelihood of the establishment of such
               scholarships. As far as can be discovered he offered no alternative except to remark
               that there were Grammar Schools in every County,<note target="n7.39" anchored="yes"
                  TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">39</hi>
               </note> although under existing economic conditions only a few children from rural
               areas could attend the Grammar Schools.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">Contrary to what was alleged by Gregory, d'Avray's early pronouncements
               on education were marked, as we have seen, by an appearance of liberality. We must
               now examine his later statements as Superintendent of Education for further evidence
               of his views and attitudes. In 1854 he stated unequivocally in his School Report that
               while he believed in education for all, he did not believe that education for the
               poor laborer's son need be identical with that at the disposal of his wealthier
               neighbor. He then pointed to the schools of successive grades in France and Prussia,
               noting that the Primary Schools in those countries served those classes which were
               limited in time and means. It might <pb n="132" id="p132" TEIform="pb"/> be argued,
               he said, that a restricted course for the Parish Schools of New Brunswick would
               deprive many children of the opportunity of distinguishing themselves in after life,
               but geniuses were not so common as was supposed and where they did exist would find
               their way.<note target="n7.40" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">40</hi>
               </note> He then paid tribute to Massachusetts, and said that the Common School System
               of that state was devised with a view to the useful and practical, and did not
               comprise branches of study which the Parish Schools of New Brunswick were required to
               impart. Let us, he urged, try to acquire some of the admirable public spirit of
               Massachusetts, but let us not think it a glorious thing to find among us a Parish
               School in which the pupils are taught Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, English Grammar,
               Geography, and plain Needlework for fifteen shillings per quarter, and Natural
               Philosophy, Chemistry, Botany, Astronomy, Algebra, Book-keeping, the rudiments of
               Latin, and ornamental needlework for five shillings per quarter extra.<note

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">41</hi>
               </note> In a later report he made references to the changes which had swept away many
               of the distinctions that once lay like a barrier between certain classes of society.
               The results were not all good. In education the lack of instruction of former days
               was succeeded by the universal system. Education was running wild, and the popular
               education so often lauded as a blessing was but a shell of education. He declared
               that if one insisted that children of the lowest rank were as entitled to be well
               educated as children of the highest rank, one might as well assert that the poor had
               a right to the property of the rich, unless one were prepared to admit that a
               smattering of knowledge was equivalent to knowledge itself, and that as much could be
               learned in three or four years by the one class as in the ten or twelve years which
               the other class could afford to devote to school and college. Cheap schools had
               replaced expensive ones, but the superficial had usurped the place of the sound and
               thorough, and accomplishments had superseded the useful and respectable, and had
               unfitted thousands for their proper sphere of duty. The result was that those who
               were born for trade were aspiring to the professions, and young women who should be
               fulfilling their destiny behind the counter or in the servant's hall were playing
               false notes, speaking bad French, and reading trashy novels. He feared, he said, lest
               the progressive system destroy all our ancient institutions, and replace sound
               learning by a flimsy affectation of knowledge. He was glad to know that throughout
               the Province the real friends of education acknowledged that he was right in
               advocating the instruction in Parish Schools of only Reading, Writing, Spelling,
               Geography, and the History of the Province. To learn things which could never be of
               service in one's walk of life was mere waste of time. The Common School was a place
               for giving the means of education; to give there a complete education was utterly
                  impracticable.<note target="n7.42" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

            <p TEIform="p">d'Avray's solitary opponent did not hesitate to interpret portions of
               these Reports as evidence of class prejudice. Moreover, the original quarrel had not
               been with d'Avray, but with Dr. George Roberts, and Gregory's original <pb n="133"
                  id="p133" TEIform="pb"/> hostility to d'Avray may not have arisen over a
               difference of educational policy, but from the fact that d'Avray was a friend of
               Roberts. d'Avray had sided with Roberts in the quarrel which the latter had had with
               Gregory, and Gregory had hinted that the expulsion of his son from the Collegiate
               School and the backing which the College Council had accorded at the time to Roberts,
               Headmaster of the School, furnished proof of the strength in New Brunswick of those
               class distinctions with which the educational system had begun. While the details of
               the feud between Roberts and the stormy Gregory do not concern us, certain aspects of
               the case cannot be ignored, because of their social implications. From a perusal of
               the Minutes of the College Council we learn that the Council, after hearing Roberts
               and Gregory, passed a resolution to the effect that it appeared George Gregory had
               been expelled from no improper conduct on his part, and expressed the opinion that
               since the Collegiate School was a school established by legislative enactment and
               supported mainly at the expense of the province, Roberts was not justified in
               expelling any pupil for any cause but improper conduct and non-payment of the usual
               fees, and that therefore Roberts ought to readmit George Gregory to the School. In
               the face of this resolution Justice Carter then moved an amendment to the effect that
               the Board, while unable to allow the uncontrolled right of the Master of the School
               to dismiss pupils for the misconduct of the parent, were of the opinion that the
               circumstances of the case afforded sufficient justification to Roberts for the course
               he had adopted with respect to Gregory's son, and that they were such as to prevent
               the Board from directing the readmission of the boy. From this contradiction of the
               previous resolution only two members of the Council, Alexander Rankine and J. A.
               Street, dissented.<note target="n7.43" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">43</hi>
               </note> Gregory then published a pamphlet which included copies of the documents and
               letters which had figured in the affair, and described all the circumstances as they
               appeared to him. From this pamphlet we learn that Roberts, in one of his letters to
               Gregory during the quarrel, asked the latter if it did not occur to him that the
               examiners at the scholarship examinations were gentlemen, a question which may have
               had an invidious implication. We find also that Gregory, in one of his
               communications, declared that his enemies could not wound him by allusions to his
               descent, and spoke with defensive pride of his family connections.<note

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">44</hi>
               </note> Thus, indirectly, Gregory implied that among the causes of the discrimination
               from which he believed his family had suffered were the circumstances of his birth as
               a mechanic's son, and the existence in the province of a spirit of class pride and
               snobbery.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">It is possible, of course, that other factors were involved, such as a
               personal thorniness and aggressiveness in Gregory which antagonized constituted
               authorities, but the possibility that social considerations had a bearing on the case
               cannot be entirely ruled out, nor the implications of d'Avray's champion- <pb n="134"
                  id="p134" TEIform="pb"/> ship of Roberts. The inch-by-inch struggle for
               Responsible Government in progress at this time meant that exclusive privileges and
               traditional controls were passing, but passing slowly. To these illustrations which
               we have noted from time to time of public feeling on the question, we may add the
               address by John Boyd in the Hall of the Mechanics' Institute in Saint John in 1853.
               The speaker cautiously admitted that New Brunswick had class distinctions borrowed
               from the Mother Country, <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">one of her
                  lesser evils amidst her greatest good</q>. One saw it, he said, during elections,

                  aught, the only lines recognized as marking the grades that must always exist in

            <p TEIform="p">That day, however, had not yet fully come, and it is difficult to decide
               whether d'Avray, identified as he was with the social aristocracy of New Brunswick,
               fully anticipated the equalitarian doctrines that have since his time received a
               wider currency.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">It could be, of course, that d'Avray had arrived in the province with a
               stock of English liberalism which flowered on first contact with the independent
               breath of North America, but became arrested in the face of practical difficulties,
               and modified as he became identified with the official, socially prominent, and
               academic circles of a conservative capital and a still more conservative King's
               College. On the other hand, d'Avray may have kept his ideals to the end, but,
               attempting to be a realist in the midst of a culturally poor society, made
               compromises which to him seemed the acme of commonsense but were interpreted by his
               enemies as deliberate reaction.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">Two points clearly emerge, however. The practical trends in education
               which d'Avray advocated were ignored, unless they contributed to the verbal
               ammunition of those who wished to convert King's College into an Agricultural School.
               Decades were to pass before the strictly classical in secondary and higher education
               ceased to be the one and only ideal. Secondly, d'Avray's view of limited course of
               instruction for Parish Schools, whether wise or unwise, was only partially followed.
               By the Act of 1852 female teachers were called on to teach a limited curriculum, as
               likewise were male teachers of the second and third class, but male teachers of the
               first class were still required to teach Bookkeeping, Geometry, Mensuration, Land
               Surveying, Navigation, and Algebra. Trigonometry and Natural Philosophy, however,
               were dropped from the requirements. This meant, in effect, that rural areas had the
               opportunity of obtaining teachers of whom they could demand work in advance of the
               elementary. In a country economically poor and largely rural, but generally admitting
               no social barriers to ambition, this means that the door to advanced edu- <pb n="135"
                  id="p135" TEIform="pb"/> cation was at least partially open to country youths of
               ability and determination. Until comparatively recent times, this remained, for many,
               the only door. While advanced work was doubtless often carried on at the expense of
               the elementary classes, hundreds of ambitious young New Brunswickers managed to
               struggle through this narrow opening into business, the skilled trades, the teaching
               profession, and occasionally even the University. In this tendency to require the
               one-room school to do high school work, the educational policy of New Brunswick (and
               of her neighbor, Nova Scotia) has resembled that of Scotland.<note target="n7.46"

            <p TEIform="p">On the trail of d'Avray's views we have wandered far afield from the
               opening of the Normal School. We shall now consider some of the limitations and
               vexations which accompanied the operation of the School during its early years, and
               hindered it from achieving the fullest success. To begin with, the interval of
               training was only ten weeks, an inadequate period in view of the undeniable fact that
               many of the teachers needed scholastic instruction as well as pedagogic training. It
               did not take d'Avray long to discover that what the Inspectors had said on this point
               in 1845 was still true of many teachers. In his first annual report he commented on
               these deficiencies, saying that many teachers were poor readers and made constant
               mistakes in ordinary conversation. The majority knew little or nothing of Geography,
               and committing their thoughts to writing was work of the greatest difficulty. Some,
               he said, should never have been admitted.<note target="n7.47" anchored="yes"
                  TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">47</hi>
               </note> But more glaring than these deficiencies was the inability of the teachers to
               communicate the knowledge of which they were possessed, a handicap to which d'Avray
               repeatedly referred in letters and reports. <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified"
                  TEIform="q">It is as teachers&#8212;as imparters of that knowledge, that they are in
                  general so deficient, and it is in the acquirements of that art that they should
                  be principally exercised during the time of their attendance.</q>

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">48</hi>
               </note> Because of these circumstances d'Avray criticized the brevity of the training
               period, and repeatedly emphasized the opinions which he had expressed in his opening
               lecture on the desirability of instructing and training Parish School teachers in a
               knowledge of elementary subjects only. This might be done in ten weeks, he said, but
               to try to do more was absurd, and would be useless, if effected, as the wants of the
               community which could, or should be, supplied by the Parish Schools were Reading,
               Writing, Arithmetic, Grammar, and Geography.<note target="n7.49" anchored="yes"
                  TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">49</hi>
               </note> This came far short of what the Act of 1847 required of first and second
               class teachers, but of that piece of legislation d'Avray said: <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">The Act appeared to me an Absurdity and daily
                  experience convinces me that it is an impossibility also.</q> Referring to his
               opening lecture, d'Avray asserted: <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q"
                  >I promised enough to satisfy all who had more sense than to expect too much, and
                  none were dissatisfied but the <pb n="136" id="p136" TEIform="pb"/> Educational
                  Theorists whose visionary expectations it would be impossible to realize.</q>
               <note target="n7.50" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">50</hi>
               </note>
            </p>

            <p TEIform="p">Besides these difficulties, d'Avray had to face lack of enthusiasm on the
               part of the teachers. To many of these, Normal School training represented
               inconvenience without commensurate compensation, for the increase in provincial
               grants promised by the Act of 1847 to trained teachers was but slight, and the
               subscriptions required from the community were to remain unchanged. Attendance at the
               Training School therefore demanded of the teacher some immediate expense, and held
               out no prospect of eventually improved financial standing. d'Avray seems to have been
               aware of this grievance, for one of his arguments in favour of County Training
               Schools was the reduction which such schools would mean in the travelling expenses of
               teachers.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">In addition to objections to the inconvenience and expense of attending
               the Normal School, there seems to have been some criticism of the training as well,
               and possibly a disinclination to profit by it. Attorney-General Ambrose Street,
               during the debate on the School Bill of 1852, said he believed that the practice of
               sending up licensed teachers to the Training School was worse than useless, for such
               teachers would go back <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">execrating
                  the Training School, and would relapse into their old habits</q>. It was difficult
               to <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">unlearn</q> people their bad
               habits and to instruct them in the new. He knew, he said, of a man of sixty who had
               gone to the Training School to be trained as a teacher, and who thought himself a
               cleverer fellow than his teacher, only he felt himself bound to attend under the law.
               The Attorney-General said he meant by this no imputation on d'Avray, but mentioned
               these facts to show the failure of the system of training licensed teachers.<note

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">51</hi>
               </note> Inevitably the Training School became the subject of political controversy,
               as the practical problems which confronted it were seized upon by Gregory who
               assailed d'Avray as the author of all its difficulties. On the other hand Bishop
               Medley entertained a high opinion of d'Avray's ability and skill as a teacher, and
               John M. Brooke, Minister of St. Paul's Church, Fredericton wrote that, <q
                  rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">As Principal of the Training School
                  his labours have been highly appreciated, and thankfully acknowledged by a large

                  by his agreeable manners, his amiable disposition, his upright and gentle manly

               as a gentleman. If these testimonials mean anything they mean that the difficulties
               of the Training School were not of d'Avray's making.<note target="n7.52"

               the Model School he had to neglect one in order to attend the other.<note

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">54</hi>
               </note> A warning issued by D. S. Morrison before the Normal School opened may have
               some bearing on this point. Morrison, afterwards a provincial inspector for many
               years, stated in January 1848 that in his opinion, to render a normal seminary
               efficient, a plurality of teachers was absolutely necessary, for one man could not
               possess all the qualifications required to instruct the various classes of teachers
               in every branch, and if he did have the qualifications, he could not have the time.
               Morrison also said that owing to the deficiency of New Brunswick teachers in
               knowledge as well as in the art of teaching, a years attendance at least was
               necessary. His conclusion was, therefore, that in order to give the Normal School a
               fair trial, an increase in the number of teachers and an extension of the time of
               attendance were indispensable, and that the cost of such a plan would promote the
               cause of education more than the same amount expended in any other way.<note

            </p>


            <p TEIform="p">The absence of a permanent Model School presented one of the greatest
               obstacles in the way of the smooth operation of the first Normal School. At the
               opening of the latter, the parish schools of Fredericton were used in succession as
               Model School classes, an arrangement which d'Avray did not find satisfactory.<note
                  target="n7.56" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">56</hi>
               </note> Moreover, the hourly change of masters which he thought necessary in order to
               give to each teacher as much teaching practice as possible operated against the
               interests of the Model School. Evidently parents did not like the arrangement either,
               for the pupils of the Model Classes fell off in attendance. At one time there was no
               attendance for five weeks, so that a set of teachers obtained no practice for half
               their training. Finally, the Madras School in Fredericton under a Mr. Graham was
               taken on as the Model School.<note target="n7.57" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               admitted that previous to his visitation of schools in Boston, New York, and Toronto

               </note> we may suppose that female teachers, although employed to a certain extent in
               the schools of the province, were not held in very high regard. Lieutenant-Governor
               Colebrooke's plans, we remember, included the training of women for teaching, but
               when the Normal School was established the premises could accommodate such a limited
               number of teachers that the Board of Education, at an early date, decided that the
               attendance of females at the Training School should be dispensed with.<note

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">62</hi>
               </note> This, however, must have been one of the things in which d'Avray was
               frustrated by the Board, for the school does not seem to have obtained official
               standing as a training school, and in his first annual report d'Avray stated that of
               the one hundred and two teachers who had attended the Normal School only one female
               had attended, and for but a short time.<note target="n7.63" anchored="yes"
                  TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">63</hi>
               </note> As we shall see later, the training of female teachers did not begin until
               after the Normal School was founded in Saint John.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">The Act of 1847 had made reference to the establishment of subsidiary
               schools, and d'Avray, as has been shown, supported the idea. However, County Training
               Schools were never established, probably because they could not all have been made
               useful without enormous expense. New Brunswick, in thus endorsing the advantage of
               one efficient Normal School over many small training schools, was in line with Nova
               Scotia, New York State, and Upper Canada. Unfortunately, for many years the one New
               Brunswick Normal School was conducted under such conditions of cramped quarters, poor
               heating, and bad ventilation that it could not achieve real efficiency.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">Marshall d'Avray soon came to advocate support for schools in terms of
               the impetus which the adoption of the assessment principle would furnish.<note
                  target="n7.64" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">64</hi>
               </note> He also advocated inspection, pointing out that without it there was no
               guarantee that trained teachers would practise what they had learned at the Normal
                  School.<note target="n7.65" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </note> While we find no direct reference of his to the need of a Superintendent of
               Education, we note his suggestion of a series of lectures throughout the province to
               arouse interest,<note target="n7.66" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">66</hi>
               </note> a type of evangelism which only some such official as a Superintendent could
               perform. In contrast with the procedure followed in Nova Scotia and Upper Canada,
               d'Avray was afforded no opportunity of visiting the schools of other countries,
               either before he entered on his work, or in the course of his duties. In spite of all
               the talk of a Normal School for years before it was established, the Legislature did
               not seem to appreciate fully either the magnitude of the undertaking, or the minutiae
               of preparation and detail necessary to insure the utmost efficiency.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">It would appear that d'Avray found his position as Master of the Training
               School vexatious and unsatisfactory, for hardly had he arrived than he began
               corresponding with Grey on the subject of another appointment. He even expressed
               willingness to return to the Mauritius, but was advised that the position had been
               filled and no other was vacant.<note target="n7.67" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               not far to seek. The political controversy over the Training School, and the failure
               of the government to fulfil his expectations must have made this period of his life
               in New Brunswick one of considerable difficulty. Chief Justice Carter was of the
               opinion that he had been placed in a false position as a result of the factional
               conflict. His connection with the Normal School ended, however, more abruptly than he
               could ever have expected. In November, 1850, a fire occurred in Fredericton which
               destroyed the Training School, d'Avray's quarters, and many of his possessions. For a
               time his only means of subsistence was the eighty pounds he earned as a substitute in
               King's College and the Collegiate School for Professor Houseal who was absent on
               leave. Eventually, the Government of New Brunswick gave him some compensation for his
               loss by fire,<note target="n7.68" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </note> and Professor Houseal having resigned, d'Avray became Professor of Modern
               Languages at King's with full pay. Since the Province had brought him to this
               country, the Government must have felt some responsibility for his position&#8212;
               certainly d'Avray implied that they should.<note target="n7.69" anchored="yes"

               </note> At any rate, when the first Superintendent of Education had resigned, d'Avray
               was given the appointment, at the same time retaining his professorship. He ceased to
               be Superintendent of Education in 1858 but remained at King's College, and then at
               the University of New Brunswick, which King's was soon to become, until his
               death.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">With the destruction of the Training School in Fredericton, the Saint
               John School became the only institution in the province for training teachers. In
               tardy recognition of the limited accommodations at Fredericton, the Board of
               Education had responded to the solicitation of Edmund Hillyer Duval of Saint John and
               had established a second Training School in that city in the fall of 1848. Duval,
               formerly a school inspector in England and principal of a school at Bristol, had come
               to Saint John in 1845 to take charge of a school there under the auspices of the
               British and Foreign School Society.<note target="n7.70" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">70</hi>
               </note> When the Board of Education appointed him master of the subsidiary Training
               School, his classes in the British School became the Model School. He could grant
               licenses of only the second and third classes, but candidates whom he approved for
               first class might transfer to Fredericton for four weeks training and final

               </note> From 1850 until 1867 this School in Saint John was the only official training

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">72</hi>
               </note> and for nine of those years was under Duval's direction.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">It will be remembered that the British and Foreign School Society used
               the Lancastrian monitorial system. Why, one asks, was such a school established in
               Saint John in 1845 when the heyday of the monitorial system had passed? Duval's
               address at the opening of the school, August 25, 1845, ex- <pb n="140" id="p140"
                  TEIform="pb"/> plained that since the early days of the system a change had
               occurred in the <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">British</q>
               Schools, the education now given being of a more advanced character than at first.
               Hence, while the monitorial system was still used to some extent, much more direct
               and individual instruction was given by the master than formerly. Duval said that the
               system to be adopted in his school would exercise the judgment rather than burden the
               memory, and that the object was to get children to think.<note target="n7.73"
                  anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">73</hi>
               </note> Clearly, changing times had brought modifications in the old rigid memoriter
               methods of the monitorial system.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">Duval's aims for the <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q"
                  >British</q> School and d'Avray's for the Parish Schools reveal an identity of
               purpose, which may explain why d'Avray, after only a brief interview with Duval,
               readily certified the latter in 1848 as a fit master for a Training School. On the
               occasion of the opening of the <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q"
                  >British</q> School, Duval announced that the principle of the Society was to
               impart to children an eminently useful education, adapted to the circumstances in
               which they were likely to be placed. It did not offer instruction in the dead
               languages, but would give that education best suited to the mechanical and commercial
               portions of society. The course in his school, therefore, would embrace Reading,
               Writing, Spelling, Arithmetic, Geography, Grammar, English History, Natural History,
               Drawing, and Singing.<note target="n7.74" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">74</hi>
               </note> Since the <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">British</q>
               School became the Model Class for Duval's Training School, it is apparent that after
               1850 Duval either had to enlarge his curriculum to meet the requirements of first
               class teachers, or had to give first class candidates training in theory, without
               practice in teaching advanced subjects.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">The most significant change in theory and practice during the early years
               of Duval's Training School began in 1849 with the enrolment of Martha Hamm Lewis.
               This girl, in her early twenties, <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q"
                  >led the womanhood of this province in a great advance</q>. According to the
                  story,<note target="n7.75" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">75</hi>
               </note> as narrated long afterwards by her daughters, Miss Lewis had been educated by
               private tutors and in boarding school. Convinced that she knew as much as the young
               men of her acquaintance who were attending the Training School, she applied
               repeatedly for admission, but was as often refused on the grounds of custom and
               expediency. Finally she wrote the Lieutenant-Governor, who ruled that she was not
               ineligible, and the momentous hour came when an Order-in-Council directed that she be
               admitted to the Normal School. She was warned, however, that she could in no wise
               hold the Council responsible for any ill results. Duval, so runs the tale, was much
               perturbed and imposed certain regulations. She had to enter the classroom ten minutes
               before the other students and was required to wear a veil. She was asked to sit alone
               at the back of the room. retire five minutes before the lecture ended, and leave the
               premises without speaking to the male students. With these precautions, no untoward
               incident <pb n="141" id="p141" TEIform="pb"/> occurred and <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">those who had sponsored her brave step were

               </note> In the autumn of 1850 the Board of Education, in answer to a letter from
               Duval relative to the admission of female teachers to the Training School, ruled that
               he might admit as many as could be received without inconvenience in the present
               establishment, <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">but it will be

               </note> This was the beginning of a trend which quickly resulted in a plurality of
               females in attendance at the Training School, and in charge of the schools of the
               province. In 1850 Duval admitted that one of the things which had impressed him
               during his visits the previous summer to American and Canadian cities<note

               </note> was the number of females enrolled in the training schools of Boston, New
               York, Portland, and Toronto, and the number of successful female teachers in the
               common schools. He had become convinced that his prejudice against the employment of
               females was unfounded and he recommended that they be received for training.<note

               </note> In 1852, of the ninety-two students at the Saint John Training School
               forty-nine were females, and never afterwards did female students lose this
               ascendancy.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">Two conflicting views at this time of the function of a Normal School may
               be discerned. The level of learning in New Brunswick was generally low, yet the
               ambition of the John Gregorys in the province demanded that Parish School teachers
               have some knowledge of advanced subjects. Because of the tendency of the New
               Brunswick temperament toward concession, the inevitable compromise emerged. To
               d'Avray a training school was to train teachers to teach. He was dismayed to find so
               many teachers deficient in learning, and found in this circumstance further argument
               for the limited course which he advocated for Parish Schools. He also favored the
               elimination of unfit candidates by means of entrance requirements. But as might be
               expected in a naive society, many people, teachers included, looked on the Training
               School as a sort of secondary school. In 1856 d'Avray, then Superintendent of
               Education, said he had met many young men who had made heroic sacrifices to become
               better scholars, with a view to obtaining a higher class of license, but had seldom
               encountered instances of a more desirable ambition to become better teachers&#8212;as
               if, he added, becoming better scholars without becoming better teachers could add to
               their value as teachers.<note target="n7.80" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">80</hi>
               </note> In 1850 Duval had reported that the training period in the Normal School of
               Massachusetts was a year, but that most of the time was devoted to studies, each
               pupil spending only two weeks in the Model School. This, he said, differed materially
               from the plan contemplated by the <pb n="142" id="p142" TEIform="pb"/> New Brunswick
               Act. He himself thought that the time spent in the Model School in Massachusetts was
               insufficient, but the authorities there seemed satisfied that theirs was the better
                  plan.<note target="n7.81" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">81</hi>
               </note> Gregory opposed d'Avray and Duval on this point. In his report as Secretary
               in 1850, he complained that the master of the Training School was not required by the
               Act of 1847 to promote directly the elementary knowledge of the teachers, a point
               complained of by the teachers. He himself concurred in the views of the managers of
               training schools in Massachusetts, and thought that an alteration was indispensably
               necessary to meet the expectations of New Brunswick teachers and to improve their
                  efficiency.<note target="n7.82" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">82</hi>
               </note> The matter was not discussed during the debate on the Bill of 1852, and in
               reference to the training of teachers the Act of that year only mentioned instruction
               in the art of teaching and in the best methods of conducting Parish Schools.<note

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">83</hi>
               </note> It did, however, provide that the classification of teachers for license
               should be based largely on subjects, and that licenses were to be issued, not only on
               the report of the Training Master, but also on the ability of the candidates to pass
               examinations set and marked by unpaid examiners appointed from outside the Normal
                  School.<note target="n7.84" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">84</hi>
               </note> Duval, as we have seen, favored as much practice teaching as possible, but
               the quarters in which his Training School was conducted became so cramped as
               attendance grew that conditions operated against a large degree of professional
               training. It would seem, therefore, that while there was no deliberate shift of
               emphasis, there was a tacit recognition of the function of the Normal School to
               provide secondary education as well as training in teaching, and a tendency to
               emphasize the former at the expense of the latter. In 1855 d'Avray complained that
               the principle on which the training of teachers was conducted was that a little of a
               good thing was better than none at all. He said that the Act of 1852 imposed on
               candidates for first and second class such a long series of requirements that, in
               order to pass, the teachers were compelled to neglect training and instruction in the
               art of teaching, and devote themselves to the study of various branches, which, to
               them as common school teachers, were comparatively useless.<note target="n7.85"

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">85</hi>
               </note> Actually, in the Normal School which was conducted from 1867 to 1870 at
               Chatham for the teachers of the northern counties, professional instruction was given
               after the regular school hours.<note target="n7.86" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">86</hi>
               </note> All this is not to say that Principals Duval, Mills, Crocket, and subsequent
               Normal School Principals were under any misapprehension regarding the true function
               of a Normal School, but they had to do the best they could under existing
               circumstances. Popular inertia, a tendency in the public mind to confuse knowledge
               and teaching ability, the unwillingness of the legislature to provide funds for
               expansion, the inadequacy of teachers' salaries, frequent shortage of teachers, have
               all combined; even to this day, to limit the professional training received in New
               Brunswick's Normal School. But, on the other hand, it is undeniable that a teacher,
                  <pb n="143" id="p143" TEIform="pb"/> if he is to have a proper perspective, must
               know more than the curriculum he is required to teach. It would seem that in
               d'Avray's opinion existing conditions necessitated a choice between teachers able to
               teach essentials well, and teachers possessed of considerable superficial knowledge
               but of little pedagogic skill. That he believed the former was preferable to the
               latter is no conclusive proof of a belief on his part in any restrictions or
               limitations on knowledge.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">Duval had returned from his tour of schools outside the province
               impressed with the value of Teachers' Institutes, educational periodicals, school
               instruction in music, and in particular the benefits of assessment.<note
                  target="n7.87" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">87</hi>
               </note> All who were interested in the improvement of education in the province urged
               the timeliness of a new school act embodying the principle of assessment. At the same
               time, those who opposed the introduction of the principle began to bombard the
               Assembly with petitions. In 1850, for example, there were nine petitions signed by
               five hundred and seventy-six persons against an Act having for its object assessment
               for schools. During the election campaign of 1850, the leading cry had been for
               reform and retrenchment in expenditure. Among the new members elected were several
               supporters of responsible government, such as S. L. Tilley, W. H. Needham, J. H.
               Gray, and G. L. Hatheway. Wilmot and Fisher were both defeated, probably because of
               their seeming desertion of the Liberal party in 1846, when they had joined a
               Conservative government, hoping to effect a balance in the administration. The
               supporters of reform had the majority in the Assembly, but the principle of executive
               responsibility to the Assembly was not yet in full operation, and a number of
               professed reformers switched to the support of the government. In consequence, the
               Tory Executive remained in power. The unpopular question of assessment was therefore
               not pushed to a decision by a cautious Executive and a House characterized by a large
               element of uncertainty and vacillation. Moreover, the session of 1851 presented the
               legislators with a number of controversial topics, including the question of the
               Intercolonial Railway, the fate of King's College, and the initiation of money
                  votes.<note target="n7.88" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               Massachusetts, and said that when we could find a good example we should not hesitate
               to adopt it because it happened to prevail in a republican country.<note

               </note> An editorial in the same paper a week later criticized the bill because it
               said nothing about better pay for teachers, and because the assessment principle
               contained in the bill was permissive, and required a two-thirds majority of the
               inhabitants of the district. So long as people remained uneducated, they never would
               vote to be taxed. The editorial pointed to the good results of a system <pb n="144"

                  TEIform="hi">Courier</hi> published a number of letters on the subject. One such
               complained that the government, although recognizing the principle of assessment as
               right, by shifting the responsibility of refusing or granting assessment from their
               own shoulders upon the shoulders of the counties, was virtually rendering useless the
               boon which they professed to be desirous of conferring. The writer hoped that no
               member of the House would show himself such a creature of his constituency as to
               allow the existing system to continue solely from deference to the grumblings of an
               apathetic ignorance.<note target="n7.92" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

            <p TEIform="p">In spite of the existence in the province of such opinions as these, the
               government of 1852 refused to take the risk of compelling assessment for schools, and
               the Bill of 1852, which was introduced by Attorney-General Street as a government
               measure, embodied the assessment principle only in a voluntary form. From the
               Synoptic Reports of the debate of 1852, we find that inspection and the financial
               support of schools formed the chief topics of the discussion on the bill.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">Three of the leading Liberals elected in 1850 were absent from the House
               in 1852, Tilley, Simonds, and Ritchie from Saint John having resigned in 1851
               following the defection to the government ranks of two of their colleagues, Gray and
               R. D. Wilmot.<note target="n7.94" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">94</hi>
               </note> Besides Street, who was a Tory, the most vocal supporters of the assessment
               principle were Hatheway, a Liberal, Needham, a Liberal who had refused to resign
               along with his colleagues from Saint John, and Gray, who had transferred his
               allegiance and had become a member of the Tory Executive. Among the opponents of the
               principle were Hanington and John M. Johnson, both Liberals, and Barbarie, who had
               entered the House in 1850 in opposition to the government, but had later supported
               it. It would seem, therefore, that political affiliations did not materially affect
               the attitudes of members to the bill.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">Analyzing the principal speeches made during the debate, we note first a
               general admission of the failure of Normal School training alone to effect any marked
               improvement in the schools of the province. Popular indifference and the inadequacy
               of teachers' salaries received a large share of blame. Hatheway declared that <q
                  rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">People gave better wages to men
                  laboring in the woods, than the Province gave to school teachers,</q> and as a

            <p TEIform="p">A second point to be noted is the frequency with which references were

               </note> The Attorney-General compared the amounts contributed to education by the
               government of New Brunswick with the sums similarly contributed in Maine and
               Massachusetts, and said that while New Brunswick spent nearly twice the percentage
               per head, her education was in nothing like the advanced state of theirs. He referred
               to Egerton Ryerson's report on education in 1851 so that the honorable members might
               see that Canada had had to contend with difficulties also. He said that since the
               last session he had studied the Canada School Act, and had observed that in Canada
               and in Maine as much information as possible was gleaned from other countries before
               measures were passed. <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">Therefore, in
                  preparing this measure he had not drawn from his own powers, but had consulted the
                  information afforded by the experience of other countries.</q>

               </note> Needham wished that the Attorney-General had turned his attention to the
               principle of direct taxation as stated by Horace Mann. If the Attorney-General had
               done so, he would have become convinced that only one part of every hundred parts of
               the property of any man belonged to himself; <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified"
                  TEIform="q">the rest was entrusted to him for the promotion of the general
                  welfare</q>. He, Needham, wished that he could boast of being the author of such
               statements and doctrines; but at least he believed in them. He then detailed at great
               length the particulars of certain schools in the United States which he had lately
                  visited.<note target="n7.101" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">101</hi>
               </note> But while Needham and Street felt the inspiration of Upper Canada and the
               American States, other members implied that it was folly to hitch one's wagon to a
               star, taking the stand that the limitations of the province must condition policies
               and practices in New Brunswick. Barbarie, who was opposed to assessment, told Needham
               that if he had travelled a little more in New Brunswick, he would know a little more
               about how to make laws to benefit his own country. Barbarie could tell him that the
               poor settlers in the woods and rural districts of New Brunswick could not bear a
               direct tax.<note target="n7.102" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </note> Cutler deprecated the habit of exalting the institutions of the neighboring
               states and depreciating our own. <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q"
                  >The poverty of the country, the scattered state of the population, and many other
                  causes make the teachers what they are; and this it will be in great measure a
                  work of time to rectify.</q> In plain words, the legislators of 1852, even those
               who favored <pb n="146" id="p146" TEIform="pb"/> assessment in theory, seem to have
               exhibited the usual caution, the characteristic unwillingness to take progressive
               steps which might prove unpopular, and the old tendency to accept, as inevitable, a
               modest role for New Brunswick in things of the spirit. This last was in rather
               curious contrast to the feeling which was growing at the time that New Brunswick was
               about to ride high on a wave of economic prosperity, because of railway
               expansion.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">A clue to the attitude of the Legislature probably lies in Barbarie's
               statement that if they inserted a clause to make a direct tax coercive, they would
               raise a storm about their ears that they could not withstand.<note target="n7.104"

               </note> Attorney-General Street himself set the tone when he said that he favored a
               direct tax, and always had, but was satisfied it could not be effected compulsorily.
               The bill, therefore, gave permission to assess, and held out inducements to encourage
               voluntary acceptance of the principle.<note target="n7.105" anchored="yes"

                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">we wot not of</q>, and therefore preferred the

               </note> Later, he declared that the premium offered for voluntary assessment would
               mean that rich and urban districts which could afford assessment would get the
               premium, while poor rural districts which really required aid could get none.<note

               inoperative in rural areas where people could not command the use of money. It might
               do all right in Fredericton, the abode of public officials whose salaries were
               certain and regular, and in York County where everything represented money. Under the
               present system the schools had made progress&#8212;indeed he had heard it said by
               persons from Maine that the schools in New Brunswick were in a better shape, as a

               </note> but argued in its favor. Every child, he said, had a right to an education,
               and, as Horace Mann had argued, <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">the
                  wealthy should bear the burden of educating the children with more pleasure than
                  the burden of supporting gaols or poor houses</q>.<note target="n7.112"

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">112</hi>
               </note> Needham, whose support of anything was always wholehearted, believed that the
               Government were bound, even at the risk of their seats, to force direct taxation on
               the people. <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">Some laws must
                  necessarily be coercive, and this was one of them.</q> One thing a Legislature
               ought to do was to take care that the people they ruled, and the children of the
               people they ruled, were educated, for it was a self-evident fact that nations were
               strong in proportion to their intelligence. <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified"
                  TEIform="q">If the Legislature waited for all the people of this Province to
                  consent to adopt direct taxation, they would never have it at all.</q> He himself,
               during the past summer, had prepared a bill based on the principles of direct
               taxation and the system of schools in Massachusetts and Maine, and he believed his
               own bill was better than the Government one, but he had not introduced it, believing
               it would not be carried in opposition to a Government measure. If he were a member of
               the Government, yes, if he were the whole Government, he would soon have his bill in
               operation, and he would stake his existence on the success of the system. In a burst
               of generosity he said he would give the Committee on Education his bill, if they
               liked, would say goodbye to his own child, and would throw off any glory that might
               be supposed to attach to himself as the author of it. In a concluding burst of
               oratory he cried: <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">Educate the
                  people and make them free; educate the people and make them happy: educate the
                  people and keep them from crime and misery.</q>

            <p TEIform="p">This question of assessment occupied the major part of the debate, but
               the subject of inspection came in for considerable discussion also. The Act of 1847
               had provided for the appointment of two inspectors, but according to the
               Attorney-General the appointments had not been made.<note target="n7.114"

               appointed. The Attorney-General himself favored having three at £ 250 each per annum,
               rather than the suggestion of fourteen at £ 50 each, for there must be provision also

               Schools, such as they had in Massachusetts, provided for out of the college funds,
               and free to select pupils from the parish schools<note target="n7.124" anchored="yes"

            <p TEIform="p">The Bill of 1852, in its final form as <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">An Act for the better establishment and

                  TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">125</hi>
               </note> incorporated three features of importance, in addition to those which we
               examined earlier in connection with the licensing of teachers. In the first place,
               the Board of Education was enlarged to include a Superintendent of Education who was
               to be Secretary of the Board also, at a total salary of £ 200 per annum, with £ 50
               allowed for travelling expenses and contingencies of office. Secondly, there were to
               be county inspectors appointed by the Governor in Council. These were to inspect each
               school in their respective counties four times a year. They were to be paid at the
               rate of 7s. 6d. for each inspection, and were guaranteed a minimum salary of £ 50 a
               year. Obviously, the Legislature did not consider that the task of inspection was a
               full-time job! Thirdly, districts or parishes were permitted to assess themselves for
               the support of schools. Any district or parish adopting the assessment principle
               would receive a bonus of 25% on the government allowance, and pupils attending the
               school would not be required to pay a tuition fee in excess of the sum of 2s. 6d. per
               quarter. As d'Avray pointed out in 1854, those who framed the Act made a mistake in
               not including, for assess- <pb n="149" id="p149" TEIform="pb"/> ment purposes, the
               property of non-resident proprietors,<note target="n7.126" anchored="yes"
                  TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">126</hi>
               </note> an oversight which probably partly accounted for the general failure of
               districts to avail themselves of the opportunity afforded by the Act for
               assessment.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">The Act continued the provisions for the Training School at Saint John,
               extended the period for training to three months, and, by making allowance for a
               female teacher at the Model School, indicated that females were expected to attend
               the Training School. However, to encourage males in the profession, the Act made a
               distinction between the provincial allowance for male and female teachers. Males of
               the three classes were to receive £ 30, £ 20, and £ 18, while the grants to females
               were set at £ 14, £ 18, and £ 20. Districts were required to contribute an amount
               equal to the provincial allowance,<note target="n7.127" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">127</hi>
               </note> but the equivalent might still be furnished in board and washing. Teachers
               already licensed who failed to attend the Training School were to revert to third
               class. All licenses were henceforth to be signed by the Superintendent. The Act also
               contained clauses relating to Inspectors' and Superintendent's reports and to
               teachers' registers, and made provision for the continuance of an allowance to those
               who attended the Normal School. To put an end to the scores of petitions received
               annually in the Legislature, the Act declared that the Legislature would not in
               future entertain any petition of a school teacher, unless it was sanctioned by the
               Board of Education. As we shall see later, until the Executive assumed the
               responsibility of provincial finances there was no marked reduction in the number of
               petitions annually presented to the Legislature.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">According to the debate, the legislators of 1852 realized that a
               connection existed between the inadequacy of teachers' salaries and the generally
               poor state of the schools. Nevertheless the Act of 1852 did practically nothing to
               improve the financial status of teachers. This omission did not pass unnoticed. While
               the Bill was still before the House, <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified"
                  TEIform="q">A Patriot</q> complained that the Bill neglected the wants of teachers
               and people alike, and asserted that in many parts of the province parochial teachers
               resembled mendicants in their attire, and that only Bacchanalians and the decrepit
               would pursue the vocation because of the insignificant sums which teachers received.
               This particular critic thought that the solution was to have the Government pay the
               whole salary from mean's realized in an indirect way,<note target="n7.128"
                  anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">128</hi>
               </note> but others blamed the Government for failing to make assessment compulsory,
               and bewailed popular indifference. <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q"

                  another, that duty would be, for each and all, to explain and impress upon every

               of their seats.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">d'Avray applied for the position of Superintendent, but the appointment
               was given to the Reverend James Porter. Edwin Jacob, Vice-Principal of King's, wished
               to be one of the inspectors but he too was disappointed. Lieutenant-Governor Head
               wrote to Jacob that he would like to comply with the request, but that in these
               matters he had to be guided pretty much by his Council&#8212;a significant statement
               from the standpoint of responsible government. He added: <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">Indeed, one great objection I have to the present
                  bill is the patronage which it gives to the government, in the certainty that such
                  patronage cannot be in all instances properly distributed.</q>
               <note target="n7.130" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">130</hi>
               </note>
            </p>

            <p TEIform="p">James Porter held the position of Superintendent for less than a year.
               When it was rumored that he was about to terminate his engagement, the Fredericton
               Head Quarters remarked that his resignation was to be regretted and also rejoiced in
             &#8212;regretted, because his place would be hard to fill, and rejoiced in because the
               resignation would probably in the end teach (if anything would) the public and the
               Legislature where the real difficulties existed in working out a scheme of liberal
               public instruction.<note target="n7.131" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">131</hi>
               </note> What these difficulties were is not clear. At any rate, Porter resigned, and
               d'Avray became Superintendent in his place, at the same time retaining his
               professorship at King's.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">From 1852 onwards the reports of the Superintendent and of the inspectors
               regularly furnished information about the schools. However, aside from expressing
               approval of assessment, they give scarcely any inkling of what the writers were
               thinking or reading. Among the more interesting items gleaned from these reports
               between 1852 and 1855, the following are as revealing as any.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">In 1853 Superintendent Porter showed that only one third of the children
               of the province between the ages of six and sixteen years of age attended the Parish
               Schools. There were 107 schoolhouses made of logs, and 380 schools had neither yard
               nor privy. The Irish National Books were still sanctioned by the Board, together with
               Lennie's English Grammar and Pinnock's Catechism of the History of England and
               America. There was as yet no geography with maps for the teaching of New Brunswick
                  geography.<note target="n7.132" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">132</hi>
               </note> The inspectors generally complained of the negligence and selfishness of
               Trustees in marking off school districts. Cases were known where Trustees were
               selected in direct opposition to their predecessors for the sake of altering the
               location of school districts. Books were scarce and of a wide variety. Parents were
               apathetic, in some cases because of poverty, but not in all, for in general the
               ordinary business of the country had never been in a more prosperous state.
               Irregularities existed. One Inspector found a teacher who received only £ 6 a year
               from the inhabitants, and boarded himself. In some instances the contracts stipulated
               that the teacher <pb n="151" id="p151" TEIform="pb"/> should have Friday and Saturday
               to himself. Erroneous ideas prevailed in regard to assessment, some people believing
               that compulsory assessment meant there would be no support at all from the
                  government.<note target="n7.133" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">133</hi>
               </note>
            </p>

            <p TEIform="p">Reports for 1853 were in a similar vein, particularly with reference to
               school districts and popular apathy. Duval cited examples of the embarrassment to
               teachers which boarding around often entailed. In one case a teacher was asked if he
               would defer his period of boarding with one of the families for some time, because
               flour was so dear at the time.<note target="n7.134" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">134</hi>
               </note> The reports presented in 1855 gave further instances of the same sort. The
               Superintendent noted that teachers were sometimes paid in potatoes, buckwheat, and
               socks, all charged at the very highest rates in orders upon the stores, where the
               unfortunate teachers obtained indifferent goods at exorbitant prices.<note
                  target="n7.135" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">135</hi>
               </note> One inspector reported a case in Gloucester County where an increase in the
               teacher's salary was made by raising the price of the produce, in which, by previous
               agreement, the teachers were paid.<note target="n7.136" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">136</hi>
               </note> The Superintendent also pointed to the time which teachers lost in travelling
               about, seeking a vacant school, visiting the inhabitants and obtaining subscriptions,
               and calling upon the Trustees for approbation and signatures. He suggested that
               engagements should be made through the local Inspector, who should have authority to
               institute proceedings in an action for debt for the sums which were promised. This,
               of course, would add to the duties of the inspectors, who should be reduced in
               numbers and given salaries to make their positions full-time. The Superintendent
               himself should receive more than £ 50 for travelling expenses if he was to know the
               province and the teachers.<note target="n7.137" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">137</hi>
               </note> Because of the odious conditions attached to teaching, and because of the
               increased commercial prosperity of the province, the teachers, especially male
               teachers, were leaving the profession for more highly paid employment. Superintendent
               d'Avray implied that New Brunswick, like the Mother Country, had made the mistake of
               overlooking the fact that as the teacher is, so is the school. At the laying of the
               cornerstone of the Toronto Normal School, he said, the late Governor General of
               Canada had alluded to this, saying that it was difficult to find a more flagrant
               error of putting effect before cause than that exhibited in the course pursued by the
               friends of education in England and other countries, who for years had busied
               themselves in building schools, and endeavoring to induce children to attend them,
               without ever enquiring whether competent teachers could be secured, and without
               taking any efficient and vigorous steps to supply an admitted want of qualified
               teachers. Since 1846, however, England had been pursuing a more enlightened policy,
               and, by implication, d'Avray inferred that New Brunswick must do the same.<note
                  target="n7.138" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">138</hi>
               </note>
            </p>

            <p TEIform="p">There is something pathetic about the fact that year after year
               Superintendents and inspectors penned reports similar in nature to the above. These
                  <pb n="152" id="p152" TEIform="pb"/> officials, no matter how zealous in
               admonishing teachers and in informing the public, could work no sudden miraculous
               change in the character of the Parish schools. Year after year the Government and
               Legislature received their reports and, as often, failed to act on the information
               and suggestions therein presented, thereby robbing the work of such officials of much
               of its significance.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">In 1854 the efficiency and usefulness of King's College were again
               vigorously attacked. As a result, five commissioners were appointed to consider the
               state of the college. Three residents of New Brunswick, the Honorable J. H. Gray, the
               Honorable James Brown, and the Honorable J. S. Saunders were members of the
               Commission, along with two distinguished educationists from outside the province,
               Egerton Ryerson from Canada West, and J. W. Dawson from Nova Scotia.<note
                  target="n7.139" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">139</hi>
               </note> While King's College and university education formed the principle theme of
               their report, the Commissioners envisioned such a linking of all the educational
               institutions of the Province in one comprehensive system that they felt unable to
               limit themselves to a consideration of the college alone. The report stressed the
               necessity of the recognition and application of the vital principle that every child
               had the right to such an education as would fit him for Christian citizenship, and
               that every man is bound to contribute in order to secure to every child the enjoyment
               of that right.<note target="n7.140" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">140</hi>
               </note>
            </p>

            <p TEIform="p">Referring to the Normal and Model Schools, the Commissioners indicated
               that these institutions had been only partially successful, if not failures, and
               implied that this was because of inadequate facilities and meagre financial support.
               New Brunswick could have premises as spacious, and buildings as noble, as those in
               Canada West, at the expense of £ 1000 for procuring and fitting up the premises and
               apparatus, and £ 1000 a year for the support of the institution. A good Normal School
               and public libraries were, the Commissioners thought, absolutely indispensable. <note
                  target="n7.141" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">141</hi>
               </note>
            </p>

            <p TEIform="p">Since the Parish Schools were in fact the colleges of nine-tenths of the
               people, <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">to despise those Schools,
                  to neglect them, to make or keep the Parish School House the poorest and most
                  comfortless place in the Parish, is clearly most impolitic and unwise</q>. Again
               the Commissioners pointed to Canada West, where the inhabitants had resolved that the
               buildings for elementary education should be no less convenient and complete, in
               their kind, than those for classical and scientific education. As a result the body
               of the people were more elevated and more capable of appreciating what was noble and
                  refined.<note target="n7.142" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">142</hi>
               </note>
            </p>

            <p TEIform="p">The Commissioners stressed the importance of the office of Chief
               Superintendent, which, incidentally, they thought should be combined with that of the
               Head of the University. Since such an administrative position required high
               qualifications, the remuneration should be sufficient to attract qualified persons.
               As Dr. Wayland, President of Brown University, had said, <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">it was bad econ- <pb n="153" id="p153"
                     TEIform="pb"/> omy to employ inferior talent to do badly that which could only
                  be of service when it was done well</q>.<note target="n7.143" anchored="yes"
                  TEIform="note">

               </note>
            </p>

            <p TEIform="p">While this report produced no immediate action in connection with the
               College, the Normal School, or the Parish Schools, a number of the Commission's
               recommendations were eventually applied to the College; and in the School Act of 1858
               the influence of the Commission may be discerned in the encouragement afforded to
               school libraries, and in the clauses which provided for clerical assistance and
               increased salary for the Superintendent of Education. One of the most interesting
               things about the appointment of the Commission lies in its significance as an
               indication of an increasing tendency in New Brunswick to look to other parts of
               America, rather than across the Atlantic. The adoption of such models as
               Massachusetts and Canada West practically guaranteed the eventual development in New
               Brunswick of a system of schools open to all, and forming an educational ladder
               reaching from the lowest to the highest institution in the province. Obviously, the
               next time the provincial authorities felt impelled to import an educationist they
               would turn, not to England as they had done in 1847, but to one of the sister
               colonies in North America.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">The ratification of the Reciprocity treaty in this same year, 1854, was
               an instance in the economic field of the way in which the interests of New Brunswick,
               of necessity, were becoming more and more identified with the continent of North
               America. It is true that certain features of this commercial treaty between the
               United States and the British provinces of North America were not popular in the
               Maritimes, the latter inclining to the belief that their fisheries were being
               sacrificed to the interests of the Province of Canada.<note target="n7.144"

            <p TEIform="p">It was during this particular session of the Legislature that the
               Honorable Charles Fisher introduced a resolution declaring that the conduct of the
               administration during the last four years had not been in accordance with the
               principles of self-government. This resolution having been carried by a large
               majority, Fisher formed a new administration composed of members responsible to the
               Assembly, and at the next session in 1855 the new Government started action to put an
               end to the old wasteful system of appropriations, and to vest in itself the
               initiation of all money grants.<note target="n7.147" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

            <p TEIform="p">Coincident with all this, the Province was experiencing a mighty
               preoccupation with the question of railways&#8212;a preoccupation which featured a wide
               range of emotions, many rival schemes, and a number of overly ambitious ventures. In
               1853, when the New Brunswick section of the European and North American railway was
               begun&#8212;a railway which was to connect Halifax and Saint John with the railway lines
               of the United States&#8212;there was great rejoicing.<note target="n7.150"

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">150</hi>
               </note> Hopes were still high, also, that the Imperial Government would assist the
               British provinces of North America in the building of an Intercolonial railway from
               Halifax to Quebec. Both projects, as it happened, were doomed to disappointing
               delays, but this was not yet apparent. The future seemed bright; there was commercial
               prosperity; New Brunswick ships still sailed the seven seas; soon shining rails would
               lead west and southwest; Responsible Government had been achieved; the province could
               boast of having much of the educational machinery which larger, more populous, and
               more prosperous states had achieved. All the kaleidoscopic bits and pieces of the
               previous twenty years seemed to be shaping into one simple splendid pattern&#8212;
               Prosperity. All the wavering lights and fitful flashes of those years seemed to be
               blending into a new radiance. One could almost believe, in 1854, that for New
               Brunswick a Golden Age lay just ahead.</p>

                  opinion is corroborated by that of Eldon Mullen, one of d'Avray's students who was

                  good humour, and especially his composure may have irked the impetuous

                  at this same session a petition was received from the Trustees of St. Stephen
                  Academy stating that the inhabitants of St. Stephen had subscribed a large sum,
                  and had built a School House for the purpose of establishing an Academy of a very
                  superior nature. The petitioners therefore asked for aid in fitting up their
                  school with the necessary library and apparatus (Journal of House of Assembly of
                  New Brunswick, 1852, p. 53; also Debate of House of Assembly of New Brunswick,
                  1852, p. 24.) St. Andrews, it will be recalled, was the first place in New
                  Brunswick, outside of Fredericton and Saint John, to establish a Grammar School.
                  In view of these indications of interest in education on the part of Milltown, St.
                  Stephen and St. Andrews, it is only logical to suppose that the proximity of these
                  towns to the American border exerted an influence.</note>

               <p TEIform="p">The Golden Age, however, was over almost before it had arrived.
                  Perhaps, like the happy state of youth, it existed more in anticipation, and later
                  in retrospect, than in actual fact. Continuing the analogy, one may say that with
                  its passing there came to the province many sobering realizations, many vexing
                  problems, a number of great decisions, and the acceptance of new ties and
                  relationships.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">In this period of nearly two decades there were only two Acts relating
                  to parish schools. The first of these, the Act of 1858, was passed by what was
                  popularly called the <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">Smasher</q>
                  government, but even the <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q"
                     >Smashers</q> did not dare to insist on compulsory assessment for school
                  purposes, in the face of the persistent opposition to such a reform. Before any
                  government had developed the necessary courage and determination to face this
                  issue, and the still more delicate question of non-sectarian schools, the province
                  was caught up in the whole complicated set of circumstances which led to
                  Confederation. It was inevitable, therefore, that further school legislation
                  should await the outcome of the constitutional question and the many adjustments
                  which the new order of things necessitated.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">While the interval between the Act of 1858 and the Free School Act of
                  1871 was a momentous period, the four years from 1854 to 1858 were not without
                  excitement. Not a little of this was provoked by the prohibitory liquor law of
                  1855. This premature measure was introduced by Tilley as a private bill, and
                  passed the House by a slim majority. An effort was made in 1856 to have the law
                  repealed but without success. It is not clear whether the disorder, which, it was
                  alleged by the Courier, prevailed in the Assembly toward the close of the session,
                  was the result of feeling on this question, or was an expression of disappointment
                  over the inability of Jackson &amp; Co. to complete their contract for building
                  the European and North American railway. Whatever the cause, the proceedings of
                  the House, if accurately described by the Courier, were indicative of a
                  regrettable lack of dignity. The editor of the paper mentioned said that the order
                     <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">to clear the galleries</q>,
                  which generally was <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">a pretty

                     frequency from the Speaker's chair. . . . In a deliberative body, which is

               <p TEIform="p">In a few days the editor of the Courier was able to turn from shaking
                  his head over the Assembly to shaking his fist at the Governor, for that official,
                  the Honourable J. H. T. Manners-Sutton, to whom the liquor law was objectionable,
                  had precipitated a constitutional crisis shortly after the close of the session by
                  dissolving the House against the advice of his Council. In the election which
                  ensued, those who opposed prohibition had to vote, perforce, for the new
                  government, although in doing so they seemed to uphold the right of the Governor
                  to override the wishes of his advisers. The outcome of the election was probably
                  not so much a vindication of the Governor's action as an indication <q
                     rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">that all sumptuary laws which
                     are intended to regulate human affairs, must be ineffectual unless they have
                     the support of a large majority of the people affected by them</q>.<note

               <p TEIform="p">The campaign was marked by bitterness of feeling and violence of
                  language. Among the names which were bandied about were the terms <q rend="inline"
                     direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">Rummies</q> and <q rend="inline"
                     direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">Smashers</q>, as designations for the Tories
                  and Liberals respectively. What we are most interested in, however, are the social
                  aspects of the controversy, as dealt with by the Courier in a long editorial
                  reviewing the history of colonial government in New Brunswick. Here we find
                  evidences of anti-Tory feeling highly reminiscent of Glenie. Speaking of the
                  Governor, Council, and Judges of the early days, the editor wrote: <q
                     rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">These latter were generally sent
                     out from England, received enormous salaries, and strutted on their little
                     platform with all the airs of a genuine aristocracy, to the wonder and
                     admiration of the poor Provincials who had to work for their living, and who
                     could only look from a distance at the honours and dignities which were placed
                     beyond their reach .... In the process of time the descendants of this original
                     aristocracy, educated in a college provided at the public expense, for their
                     sole use and benefit, fell heirs to the snug berths of their progenitors, and
                     so was at length formed a general Colonial aristocracy, without the pale of
                     which all were held as common people, or plebeians, none of whom had the
                     remotest chance or hope of office or power in their native land</q>. If, said
                  the editorial, <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">we have been
                     rescued from this state of slavery, it is not, we are sorry to say, to the
                     intelligence, love of freedom, or patriotism of New Brunswickers that we owe
                     it. Too many were always found here to lick the hand of power and bow the knee
                     to oppression, and although some contended manfully for their rights, it was
                     reserved for Canada to take the bull by the horns, and force from the hands of
                     a corrupt oligarchy that right of self-government which is the inherent right
                     of all intelligent people</q>. The British Government, when it granted
                  responsible government to Canada, <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified"
                     TEIform="q">in the same despatch pressed it upon the acceptance of Nova Scotia

                     TEIform="q">In this Province, unfortunately, our House of Assembly proved
                     recreant to their trust, and allowed the old 'Family Compact' party to retain
                     power, forgetting that as they had condemned Responsible Government as
                     Responsible Humbug, they were bound to make it turn out so</q>. Up to the <pb

                     slavish truckling to the Governor's behests of the men in power, the people at
                     the last General Election returned representatives who by a majority of 29 to
                     11 declared the country had no confidence in 'Family Compacts'.</q> A
                  Government was then formed from among the common people, of the sons of
                  carpenters, shopkeepers and farmers, who when tried, were found as capable at
                  making speeches, writing despatches, or concocting financial statements as any of
                  their predecessors. However, those <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified"
                     TEIform="q">who had been long habituated to think that in them lay the inherent
                     right to govern</q>, had done everything they could to disgust the people with
                  plebeian rule. Through the hireling press and venal writers they had vituperated
                  and misrepresented the Government, attributing to it the breaking down of the
                  railway scheme, the discord produced by the liquor law, and the financial
                  embarrassments, deficient revenue, and depressed trade resulting from the Crimean
                  War.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">Warming to the attack, the editor next turned his attention to the

                     constitutional advisers, and associated only with 'gentlemen', in the
                     Fredericton sense of the term.</q> Those with whom he associated had doubtless
                  led him to believe that his administration did not truly represent the people's

                  dissolution of the Assembly, had provoked the resignation of his Council, and had
                  thrown himself into the hands of the minority of the old <q rend="inline"

               <p TEIform="p">Throughout the electoral campaign the Courier featured editorials and
                  communications of the same nature. For instance, on June the twenty-first, an
                  editorial declared: <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">In the old

               <p TEIform="p">After the election was over the Courier continued to criticize the
                  Tory party, complaining particularly of the absence of an energetic immigration
                  policy on the part of Tory immigrant agents. What, asked the editor, had happened
                  to Johnson's excellent report on the agricultural capabilities of the province.
                  Four years before an English emigrant had had to hunt London for a copy, and was
                  compelled to pay six shillings for it. At the time of the Great Exhibition, the
                  Tory government had made Moses Perley the commissioner forward specimens of New
                  Brunswick produce and skill. New Brunswick had a little table four or five feet
                  square, covered with dusty black cotton velvet, in an out-of-the-way apartment. On
                  this table lay inferior samples of flinty spring wheat from the neighbourhood of
                  the Miramichi; some Indian bead work; and a copper bead of a vessel, a
                  representation of an Indian chief. We were mortified, said the editor, to turn
                  from this pitiful collection to the magnificent Canadian trophy.<note

               <p TEIform="p">We find this outspoken editor a week later blaming all the ills of the
                  country on the administration, thereby resorting to the tactics for which he had
                  condemned the Tories a short time before. It was grievous, he declared, to find
                  every man who had been for a few weeks tour in the United States and Canada coming
                  back surprised at the activity and enterprise there, and exhibiting <q

                     at the pitiful figure we cut on the scale of human progress. The few steamboats
                     we have, are of the solid steady old class that prevailed twenty years ago; we
                     have no railways, our mail coaches can scarcely accomplish a journey of a
                     hundred miles in twenty hours, and they would assuredly fail to do that if
                     Providence had not blessed us with a good soil for roadmaking. Our roads are
                     annually top dressed with the mud out of the ditches which ought to go on to
                     the fields, while stones lie in the fields which ought to be put on the roads .

                     and to make him think whether it is worth while to stay in a land where public
                     interest and public feeling seems to be dormant, and where no principles of
                     government seem to be acknowledged, or whether it is not better to fly to those
                     lands of promise of which our returned tourists give such glowing accounts</q>.
                  As for the reason for this state of affairs, for years New Brunswick had been

                     Not only have they legislated for it without regard to the external world, but
                     they have considered it piecemeal. They have never looked steadily at the good
                     of the whole Province alone; they have allowed themselves to be subject to
                     local influences and local feelings, which have generally so nearly balanced

               <p TEIform="p">At the first session of the new government, a session which lasted

                  reply to the Governor's speech was carried only by the casting vote of the
                  Speaker. This stalemate prevented vigorous action, but the session was
                  distinguished by two events of importance. For the first time the Provincial
                  Secretary brought down a budget, and a dispatch from the Colonial Office
                  surrendered the surplus civil list fund into the hands of the Provincial
                     Legislature.<note target="n8.14" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

                  <pb n="160" id="p160" TEIform="pb"/> Clearly, whatever party might be in power,
                  Responsible Government had become a fully accomplished fact.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">The position of the Government having become untenable, the Governor
                  and Council decided on dissolution. Another heated election was held and the
                  Liberals were returned to power. In the new Government, besides Fisher, who was
                  the leader, there were James Brown, S. L. Tilley, and David Wark, all men who had
                  shown interest for years in the cause of education. The times, however, were not
                  propitious for any reforms in education involving drastic financial changes.
                  Correspondence brought down at the session of 1858 on the subject of immigration
                  showed little prospect of any large gain in population from the United
                     Kingdom.<note target="n8.15" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

                  </note> The province was struggling forward with the Saint John-Shediac railway
                  which was costing far more than had been anticipated. Britain, because of her
                  operations in the Near East, which were placing a heavy strain on her treasury,
                  was not disposed to support the building of the Intercolonial railway. In fact, in
                  this year a concerted attempt on the part of the British North American provinces
                  to obtain imperial aid for the project failed.<note target="n8.16" anchored="yes"

                  feared to introduce compulsory assessment for education, particularly as the
                  question of denominational schools was becoming more controversial. For several
                  years resolutions against the continuance of provincial aid to denominational
                  schools had been defeated, and in this particular year a number of petitions were
                  presented to the House for and against the principle of such schools.<note

                  passed involving taxation for education should be founded on the system of
                  separate schools. There were also several petitions objecting to the reading of
                  the Bible in the schools, and as many or more, urging that that religious exercise
                  be made compulsory.<note target="n8.20" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">20</hi>
                  </note> The Parish School Act of 1858 therefore included no provisions for the
                  establishment of free, tax-supported, non-sectarian schools, but merely aimed to
                  correct some of the deficiencies which the passage of time had revealed in the
                  previous Act.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">Before proceeding with a study of the new statute, we must examine the
                  official reports of the Superintendent of Education and of the inspectors for the
                  interval between 1854 and 1858. We find that, as before, these officials continued
                  to express the opinion that there could be no real improvement in the parish
                  schools until taxation was universally adopted. In 1856 Superintendent <pb n="161"
                     id="p161" TEIform="pb"/> d'Avray declared that objectors must be resisted on
                  the ground that if men would not voluntarily respect the rights of society and
                  care for the temporal and eternal interests of their children, it was the right
                  and duty of society to supply the want thus sordidly and cruelly created. Society,
                  he thought, could neither forego that right without great peril, nor neglect that
                  duty without great disgrace. As Macaulay had done in England in 1847, he stressed
                  the duty of the state to provide for education as an exercise of self-protection,
                  asserting that if the sordid and the ignorant would not voluntarily acknowledge
                  that the best school is cheaper than the gallows and the gaol at any price, then
                  they must be compelled to act on that truth. Happily, there was little to fear
                  from the evils of crime and pauperism in New Brunswick, but there was the danger
                  that the liberal aid granted by the legislature towards the remuneration of
                  teachers, and the facilities afforded to the people of evading the payment of the
                  sums they ought to contribute would increase, rather than diminish, the popular
                  indifference which was known to exist. Thus the intellectual progress of the
                  rising generation would be impeded.<note target="n8.21" anchored="yes"

               <p TEIform="p">In his next annual report, Superintendent d'Avray emphasized the
                  importance of education from the vocational standpoint. Trade and commerce had
                  become professions and required a wide range of information. In every branch of
                  industry the head that planned was becoming daily of more importance than the hand
                  that executed. Scientific knowledge had ceased to be a luxury and had become a
                  necessity. The province required schools in which youth could obtain instruction
                  in those branches of knowledge best calculated to train them for a life of active
                     business.<note target="n8.22" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">22</hi>
                  </note> It is rather interesting to observe that d'Avray in this report used the
                  term <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">national</q>, referring at
                  one point to the necessity of discussing the means of providing a <q rend="inline"
                     direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">National Education</q> to enable the youth of
                  the province to discharge the duties of citizenship, and to develop the faculties
                  necessary for the working of the great machine of civil society. Thoughts of
                  nationality do not seem to have occurred with frequency or force in the minds of
                  New Brunswickers, in contrast with pre-Confederation Nova Scotians, of whom
                  Whitelaw has remarked: <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">It is
                     hardly an exaggeration to say that they had come to the very threshold of
                     nationality</q>.<note target="n8.23" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </p>

               <p TEIform="p">Had there been a stronger sense of nationality in New Brunswick, the
                  inspector for York County might not have had to complain in 1856 of the continued
                  lack of a map and history of New Brunswick suitable for school purposes. For this
                  he blamed the Legislature. It need be no matter of surprise, he said, that the
                  inhabitants of the province as a body, the parents, teachers, and children, all
                  exhibited apathy in everything connected with education, when they could not help
                  seeing indifference manifested by their representatives.<note target="n8.24"

                  </note> Actually, however, an effort was being made by the Board of Education, and
                  by the Legislature, to remedy the lack of a history. The first move seems to have
                  come from Dr. Robb of King's College, whose proposal to write a small <pb n="162"
                     id="p162" TEIform="pb"/> volume for the use of the Parish Schools, on the
                  history, geography and industrial resources of New Brunswick, was well received by
                  the Board of Education, which went on record as willing to recommend Robb's
                  proposal to the Legislature, and to aid him in obtaining a grant for the
                     purpose.<note target="n8.25" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">25</hi>
                  </note> The next significant official reference to the scheme appears under the
                  date of April 17, 1856, when Wilmot reported for a Committee of the House,
                  appointed for the purpose, that the Committee had examined a communication from
                  Robb relative to the question of procuring certain documents bearing upon the
                  early history of the province. The Committee favored the acquisition of a copy of
                  such portions of the documents as were in the archives of Canada and Paris, and
                  recommended that the sum of £ 150 should be placed at the disposal of His
                  Excellency with a view to obtaining such a copy.<note target="n8.26"

                  </note> Later in the session this sum was voted by the Legislature, although
                  twelve members of the House opposed the expenditure.<note target="n8.27"

                  it.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">The inspector's reports for the period under consideration showed that
                  many school buildings were still very inferior, and many teachers still very
                  inefficient. For instance, in 1857 most of the schoolhouses of Restigouche County
                  were reported as being log huts, and there were no trained teachers in that
                     county.<note target="n8.28" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

                  </note> The inspector for Kent County said that teachers in that county were paid
                  sometimes in money, at times in money and <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified"
                     TEIform="q">truck</q>, and not infrequently in <q rend="inline"

                  </note> The inspector for Sunbury County reported that in general the difference
                  between trained and untrained teachers was not preceptible, for in granting
                  licenses the amount of knowledge of the candidate had been made the qualification
                  rather than his teaching ability, and so there were trained teachers who did not
                  succeed in imparting knowledge, and untrained teachers who excelled in doing
                     so.<note target="n8.30" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">30</hi>
                  </note> The Superintendent, commenting on these reports, said that he felt more
                  strongly than he had ten years before at the opening of the Training School that
                  the possession of a knowledge of the higher branches did not make a teacher a
                  better teacher. The pupils at the Training School all endeavored to obtain a first
                  class license in twelve weeks. They devoted all their time and energies to the
                  necessary preparation for the examination which was to decide their rank. They
                  coached each other, and were coached by the master. Thus the Training and Model
                  School failed in its real object. Moreover, said the Superintendent, this school
                  at Saint John was working under difficulties. The building was a disgrace to the
                  province; the period of training was too short; the duties of the master were too
                  varied. The Training School at Saint John should be remodelled, and with no
                  niggardly <pb n="163" id="p163" TEIform="pb"/> hand. The Province needed something
                  like the Model and Training School in Canada, only on a smaller scale.<note

               </p>

               <p TEIform="p">In the same report the Superintendent drew attention to the monopoly
                  on schools held by third class teachers, who were popular because they taught for
                  a pittance. He had issued a circular to the inspectors calling for a closer
                  attention to the regulations relating to licensed teachers. In the past, the
                  inspectors had too readily forwarded certificates in favor of untrained candidates
                  for third class licenses. Since the inspectors were paid according to the number
                  of schools visited it was in their interests to have as many schools as possible,
                  regardless of the fitness of the teacher.<note target="n8.32" anchored="yes"

               <p TEIform="p">In addition to this report, it is probable that the case of George
                  Taylor emphasized the importance of elevating the inspectorship to the status of a
                  full-time, adequately paid, position. In August of 1853, Taylor, who was the
                  inspector for Sunbury County, applied to the Board of Education for permission to
                  teach a parish school when he was not engaged in the duties of his office. The
                  Board, however, refused permission, stating that it did not deem the duties of a
                  teacher and an inspector compatible.<note target="n8.33" anchored="yes"

                  </note> On October 29, 1855, the Board received an application from Taylor, who
                  was still inspector, requesting to be paid as a first class teacher for six
                  months' service in the parish of Sheffield, whereupon the Secretary of the Board
                  was ordered to <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">inform Mr. Taylor

                  </note> Taylor, however, petitioned the legislature, where a discussion took place
                  on the propriety of double grants. The principle of such grants was warmly opposed
                  but Taylor received his teacher's allowance.<note target="n8.35" anchored="yes"

               <p TEIform="p">Although the Fisher Government of 1855-1856 favored the right of the
                  Executive to initiate money grants&#8212;indeed a resolution to effect a change in

                  did not take place until 1857 during the short Tory regime. In 1856, therefore,
                  the Assembly could grant Inspector Taylor's petition. As a matter of fact,
                  fifty-four petitions from teachers came before the Committee of the Assembly on
                  School Petitions at this session. The Committee recommended that thirty-seven of
                  the claimants should receive varying sums, and the other seventeen claims were
                  disallowed or referred to the consideration of the House. Among the grants which
                  were recommended was an allowance of £ 50 for the teaching of a superior school at
                     Shediac.<note target="n3.36">

                  the ordinary grant. For instance, in 1852, the trustees of the St. Stephen Academy

                     TEIform="q">Superior School</q> occurred in an account of certain proceedings
                  of the House. Under the date of April 7 the special correspondent of the paper
                  described what he called a novel and interesting feature of the day's proceedings.
                  He said that one of the members, in the sincerity of his wishes for the
                  educational improvement of Magaguadavic, had moved for a sum of £ 50 to be applied
                  towards the maintenance of a Superior School in that village, whereupon several
                  members threatened that if the motion passed they would make similar motions for
                  some favored section of their own counties. The threat was carried into effect,
                  and, said the correspondent, for about twenty minutes it was nothing but 'Mr.
                  Speaker, I move for a grant of £ 50 towards the support of a superior school in
                  the Parish of&#8212;-&#8212;and County of&#8212;&#8212;-' Scarcely any opposition was offered, as
                  it was conceded that such a course would have been less than useless when the
                  principle was assented to in the first instance.<note target="n8.37"

                  </note> This makes a very interesting story, but on consulting the Journals we
                  find no record of any such proceedings. Indeed, we discover that later in the
                  session resolutions for grants for Superior Schools in St. Martin's, St. George,
                  Nelson, Hampton, Hopewell, Andover, and Bathurst were negatived.<note

                     TEIform="hi">Courier</hi> was not a reliable informant, or it is possible that
                  something of the like did occur, and that the record was later expunged from the
                  Journal, although there is no mention of any such obliteration.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">In the light of the information embodied in the official reports
                  between the years 1852 and 1858, a new educational measure, if it were to be any
                  improvement over the old, would have to raise the status of the Superintendent and
                  inspectors, apply the principle of self-government to the control of schools, and,
                  by this means and other devices, arouse a sense of local responsibility for
                  education. Naturally, a system of teacher training would have to be continued and,
                  if possible, enlarged and improved. While the inexpediency of making the
                  assessment principle compulsory seemed to be generally accepted, the existing
                  permission to assess for schools could hardly be removed, if retrogression were to
                  be avoided. From the number of petitions which had recently been presented to the
                  Assembly bearing on the question of religious instruction in schools, some action
                  in this connection also seemed unavoidable. In the early years of the province,
                  denominationalism, as we have seen, had been closely related to educational
                  endeavor. In line, however, with the general trend of the nineteenth century away
                  from denominational control of education, the parish schools of the province were
                  designed for children of all faiths, but the religious and moral purposes of
                  education had never been entirely lost sight of. Denominational catechisms were
                  frequently taught; the Bible, especially when books were scarce, was often used
                  for reading purposes; and legislative support to denominational schools had come
                  to be an accepted part of the provincial system. But Irish immigration, as we
                  noted earlier, had added considerably to the Roman Catholic population of the
                  province. Moreover, just as Nova Scotia had been New Eng- <pb n="165" id="p165"
                     TEIform="pb"/> land's outpost in the eighteenth century, so in the nineteenth
                  the northern part of New Brunswick had become an area of expansion for Quebec
                  habitants. By the middle of the century, therefore, the denominational question in
                  education had assumed something of the aspect of a Protestant-Catholic issue. As
                  we shall see, to steer a course between the growing trend against clericalism and
                  sectarianism in education, and the educational policy of the Roman Catholic Church
                  was to become increasingly difficult.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">In examining the Parish School Act of 1858,<note target="n8.39"
                     anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">39</hi>
                  </note> those sections of the Act which dealt with the problems we have just
                  raised claim our first attention.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">While under the Act the emoluments attached to the office of Chief
                  Superintendent were not as tempting as the Commission of 1854 had indicated that
                  they should be, nevertheless the position was made more attractive than formerly.
                  The maximum salary was increased to £ 300; travelling expenses and contingencies
                  of office were allowed as well; and the Chief Superintendent was to have the
                  assistance of a clerk whose maximum salary was to be £ 150. Thus the highest
                  official in the educational system of the province was freed from many of the less
                  important clerical duties of his office, and was given both the time and the means
                  to become acquainted with the educational conditions of the whole province, and to
                  carry on the highly important work of enlightening and arousing the public.
                  According to the Act, in addressing public meetings on the subject of education he
                  was to use <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">all legitimate means
                     to excite an interest therein</q>.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">To insure a better system of inspection, the Governor in Council were
                  to divide the province into four inspectorial districts, and to appoint an
                  inspector for each district at a maximum salary of £ 250 a year, including
                  travelling expenses. This salary, and the size of each inspectorial district,
                  meant that henceforth an inspector was to devote his whole time to the work of
                  inspection. While from the modern point of view the salary attached to this office
                  under the Act of 1858 seems inadequate, actually it was four or five times as
                  large as that received by the ordinary school teacher.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">When Ryerson framed the School Act of 1846 for Canada West he believed
                  that the fundamental element of the whole system was an elected board of school
                  trustees. On no point was he more careful than to make his system appear in
                  harmony with the principles of self-government. The local trustees of each school
                  section were, therefore, to be responsible to the local ratepayers, and local
                  superintendents were to be responsible to the municipal authorities.<note
                     target="n8.40" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">40</hi>
                  </note> In New Brunswick, the trustees from the beginning had been appointed by
                  the Justices of the Peace, and had the oversight of all the schools of a parish.
                  It is scarcely to be wondered at that many trustees were satisfied with a partial
                  or perfunctory performance of their duties, or frankly neglected them altogether.
                  The indifference of the trustees was but a reflection of the apathy of the people
                  in general. If the development of the practice of executive responsibility in
                  provincial government had taken many years, in local matters the application of
                     <pb n="166" id="p166" TEIform="pb"/> the principle was delayed still longer. It
                  has been said that <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">men do not
                     put off the old before the new is ready</q>.<note target="n8.41" anchored="yes"
                     TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">41</hi>
                  </note> Neither do they, except under pressure, take on the new before they
                  themselves are ready for it. The popular indifference that continually delayed the
                  improvement of the schools of New Brunswick also manifested itself in the laggard
                  development of municipal institutions. A permissive measure for the establishment
                  of municipal government was apologetically introduced by Attorney General Street
                  in 1851, but by 1858 only the towns of Carleton and Woodstock, and the Counties of
                  York and Sunbury had availed themselves of the privilege, and in the next twenty
                  years only three other areas made the change. Raymond has expressed the opinion
                  that the desire of the magistrates to retain the honor and dignity of presiding
                  over public affairs at the Quarterly Sessions was one reason for the dilatory
                  adoption of municipal government. He thought, however, that <q rend="inline"
                     direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">the chief reasons why the province was tardy
                     seem to have been the apathy of the people and the indifference of the
                     legislature. It was not the fault of the lieutenant-governors, since several of
                     them recommended the establishment of municipal government</q>.<note
                     target="n8.42" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">42</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>

               <p TEIform="p">We have earlier considered as possible reasons for this civic
                  backwardness such factors as colonial tutelage, a long period of rule by the
                  select few, economic stringencies, the influence of the lumber industry, and
                  defective early education. It is interesting to note at this point what Inspector
                  Davidson of York County said in 1856, as he contemplated the relationship between
                  public apathy, municipal institutions, and educational progress. He believed that
                  no improved system of education could be properly carried out except by means of
                  municipal institutions, and added: <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified"
                     TEIform="q">It is to their introduction that the unexampled prosperity of
                     Canada West, both in an educational point of view and otherwise, is mainly to
                     be attributed</q>. He then compared the amounts granted for educational
                  purposes by the legislatures of New Brunswick and Canada West, and claimed that
                  more than one-half as much money was distributed by the legislature of New
                  Brunswick for the benefit of a population one-fifth as great as that of Canada
                  West. However, New Brunswick, if compared with Canada West in educational
                  improvement, seemed to be standing motionless. Something, he said, must be
                  radically wrong, for as a Province the people of New Brunswick were not less
                  intelligent than the Canadians. The answer must be <q rend="inline"
                     direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">that our legislature has done too much . . . .
                     Our people have never been taught to rely upon themselves even to a small
                     extent, but they will have to learn sooner or later</q>.<note target="n8.43"

               </p>

               <p TEIform="p">Whether or not any completely satisfactory explanation can be found
                  for this state of provincial apathy, thoughtful individuals from the provincial
                  governors down to the county inspectors testified to its existence, and to the
                  retardive influences which it exerted. In the Act of 1858 we find several
                  provisions designed to arouse a sense of local responsibility for local
                  education.</p>


               <pb n="167" id="p167" TEIform="pb"/>


               <p TEIform="p">One of the most significant of the new arrangements provided that
                  three Trustees of Schools were to be elected annually in each Town or Parish, at
                  the same time and in the same manner as other Town or Parish officers, and subject
                  to the same penalties for neglect or refusal to act, or for the non-performance of
                  their duties. If, however, a Town or Parish failed to elect Trustees, the Sessions
                  were to appoint as usual. In incorporated Towns, Cities, or Counties, the Council
                  was to appoint the Trustees a provision which may have been included for the
                  purpose of encouraging the adoption of municipal government. We notice at once
                  that with respect to Trustees the Act of 1858 did not proceed so far in the
                  direction of local responsibility for schools as did school legislation in Canada
                  West, where the Trustees were elected for the local school district or section,
                  and were therefore responsible for the oversight of only one school. Not until
                  1871 was this procedure adopted in New Brunswick, and the practice of having Town
                  or City Councils appoint Trustees has been continued to the present time, a
                  practice which means that the people of urban districts exercise only second-hand
                  control over their School Trustees.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">While under the Act of 1858 the Trustees continued to exercise many of
                  the same duties that previous acts had laid down, and while they continued to be
                  responsible for all the schools of their parish, some of their former duties now
                  devolved on local School Committees. Such Committees were to be elected by the
                  ratepayers of the District at an annual meeting called by the Trustees on a notice
                  of seven days. In specifying the duties of these local bodies the Act declared: <q
                     rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">The School Committee shall have
                     the immediate charge of the School House, with the furniture, apparatus and
                     grounds. They shall, when necessary, call meetings of the inhabitants of the
                     District for the purpose of providing a School House, books, maps, apparatus,
                     school furniture and fuel, and for the support of the School and the comfort of
                     the scholars. They shall have the immediate control of any Library provided by
                     the District, and may appoint a Librarian, Secretary, and Treasurer. They shall
                     receive and appropriate any money raised in the District for the purpose of
                     providing a Library or increasing the same. The School Committee may admit as
                     many free scholars, and also children at reduced rates, being the children of
                     poor and indigent parents, as they may deem prudent and just</q>.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">Clearly, the purpose of these administrative changes was to secure
                  local interest in the welfare of the Parish Schools, and to encourage greater
                  responsibility and a more faithful performance of duty on the part of local
                  authorities. In the Act of 1847 a long step had been taken in the direction of a
                  central authority for the whole province, and in the Act of 1852 the centralizing
                  process had been more or less completed by the appointment of a Chief
                  Superintendent of Education. But in local administration no change had been made
                  since the year 1816, although the fact had been long apparent that the Trustees
                  either could not, or would not, take a proper interest in all the schools of a
                  parish. The Act of 1858 represents, therefore, a step towards the decentralization
                  of local school government, but not a full stride. It was apparently felt by those
                  who framed the Act that a more sudden and complete change to local Boards <pb
                     n="168" id="p168" TEIform="pb"/> of Trustees would be premature at this time,
                  and that half-way measures should be tried out first.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">Besides these administrative changes there were other features of the
                  Act of 1858 which aimed to arouse interest in education and to encourage local
                  expenditure for better schools. One of these was the establishment of Superior
                  Schools. If the inhabitants of any School District should raise by assessment or
                  otherwise, for the support of a Superior School, the sum of £ 50 or upwards, and
                  had engaged a competent Teacher, they were to receive from the Province a sum
                  equal to the amount so raised, but not exceeding the rate of £ 5 per annum. When
                  the inspector had certified that the school had been taught to his satisfaction,
                  and that the teacher had received £ 50 or more from the inhabitants in cash,<note
                     target="n8.44" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">44</hi>
                  </note> then the Provincial grant would be paid to the teacher, but not more than
                  one such school would be assisted in a Parish. The establishment of these schools
                  was an encouragement to first class teachers, and to the inhabitants of a district
                  who wished to have the services of the best teachers, and were willing to pay for
                  the advantages of a good school. Eventually Superior Schools were to become a
                  special type of school, midway between the Parish Schools and the Grammar Schools,
                  but in the Act of 1858 nothing was said about the curriculum or the attendance. In
                  other words, the Superior School at this time was thought of merely as a better
                  grade of Parish School, to which the Government would give special aid in
                  recognition of special interest and initiative on the part of the people.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">Another way in which the Act of 1858 offered encouragement and special
                  assistance to those who were willing to help themselves was through a provision
                  for the establishment of School Libraries. The section of the Act on this point
                  reads: <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">Whenever any School
                     District shall raise a sum of money for the purpose of establishing a Library,
                     or increasing any one already established, they shall be entitled to receive
                     from the Provincial Treasury a sum equal to half the amount so raised, to be
                     expended in the purchase of Books therefor, not to exceed five pounds in any
                     one year</q>. One of the duties of the Board of Education, as laid down in the
                  Act, was <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">to provide for the
                     establishment, regulation, and government of School Libraries, and the
                     selection of Books to be used therein; but no works of a licentious, vicious,
                     or immoral tendency, or hostile to the Christian religion, or works on
                     controversial theology, shall be admitted</q>.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">Finally, special grants were again offered to districts and parishes
                  which might adopt the principle of assessment. The bonus, however, was reduced
                  from 25% to 10% of the sum raised by taxation. Although counties and
                  municipalities were also permitted by the Act to adopt the taxation principle, no
                  special grant was provided for such areas. During the next decade frequent
                  references were made to this omission as a flaw in the Act, and as a drawback to
                  the adoption of assessment by municipal institutions. As we shall see, the general
                  failure of districts, counties, and municipalities to adopt taxation for <pb
                     n="169" id="p169" TEIform="pb"/> schools under this Act in the end necessitated
                  legislation forcing school districts to tax themselves for the support of their
                  schools.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">With regard to the Training School, the Act of 1858 foreshadowed no
                  significant changes. We note that allowances for the expenses of teachers who
                  attended the School were to be continued, but no allowance was to exceed £ 6 to
                  any one teacher. The salary of the master of the Training School was not to exceed
                  £ 250 per annum; the maximum salary of the male teacher of the Model School was
                  set at £ 125 per annum; and that of the female teacher was fixed at £ 75 per
                  annum.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">In the light of the controversy which arose later over the provisions
                  of this Act for religious and moral teaching, the exact wording of that section of
                  the Act which legislated on this question is of extreme importance. Section VIII,
                  listing the duties of teachers under the Act, stated: <q rend="inline"
                     direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">Every teacher shall take diligent care, and
                     exert his best endeavors to impress on the minds of the children committed to
                     his care, the principles of Christianity, morality and justice, and a sacred
                     regard for truth and honesty, love of their country, loyalty, humanity, and a
                     universal benevolence, sobriety, industry and frugality, chastity, moderation
                     and temperance, order and cleanliness, and all other virtues which are the
                     ornaments of human society, but no pupil shall be required to read or study in
                     or from any religious book, or join in any act of devotion objected to by his
                     parents or guardians; and the Board of Education shall, by regulation, secure
                     to all children whose parents or guardians do not object to it, the reading of
                     the Bible in Parish Schools&#8212;and the Bible, when read in Parish Schools by
                     Roman Catholic children shall, if required by their parents or guardians, be
                     the Douay version, without note or comment</q>. When, under the Act of 1871,
                  sectarian schools were deprived of a government allowance, the Roman Catholics
                  claimed that this section of the Act of 1858 had permitted them to have separate
                  schools. Thus a clause in the Act of 1858, designed to satisfy all parties, later
                  became one of the focal points in a bitter denominational controversy which
                  penetrated to the Canadian House of Commons, and to the highest court in the
                  Empire.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">The regulations of the Act relating to the qualifications of teachers
                  differed very little from similar regulations in the Act of 1852. Male teachers of
                  the first class were to teach Spelling, Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, English
                  Grammar, Geography, History, Book-keeping, Geometry, Mensuration, Land Surveying,
                  Navigation, and Algebra, while female teachers of the same class were to teach
                  Needlework and the first seven subjects named for male teachers. Second class male
                  teachers were required to teach the same subjects as first class male teachers,
                  with the omission of Geometry, Mensuration, Land Surveying, Navigation, and
                  Algebra. Second class female teachers were to teach the same subjects as second
                  class male teachers, with the omission of History and Bookkeeping, and the
                  addition of Needlework. The requirements for third class teachers of both sexes
                  were simple&#8212;Spelling, Reading, Writing and Arithmetic, with the addition of the
                  inevitable Needlework in the case of females. The Act required all teachers of the
                  first and second class to impart a knowledge of the <pb n="170" id="p170"
                     TEIform="pb"/> Geography, History and Resources of the Province of New
                  Brunswick and the adjoining North American colonies.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">The provincial allowance for teachers of the various classes was as
                  follows:</p>

               </p>
               <p TEIform="p"> The payment of the government grant was contingent on the payment of
                  an equal sum, or its equivalent, by the inhabitants of the district. In other
                  words, the objectionable practice of paying the teacher in board and washing might
                  be continued.</p>


               <p TEIform="p">Of the remaining provisions of the Act, the majority of which were of
                  a routine nature, we shall note only two. Penalties were fixed for the
                  misappropriation of school funds by School Committees, and for the making of false
                  returns by teachers and inspectors. Among the powers of the Board of Education was
                  that of making regulations for the construction and ventilation of school houses,
                  and for the furniture and apparatus to be used. The Chief Superintendent was to
                  provide the necessary plans for the construction of school buildings, and was to
                  encourage the improvement and embellishment of the school grounds. We find that
                  about a month after the Act came into effect the Board of Education recorded a
                  minute to the effect that the Superintendent should keep in his office, ready for
                  immediate reference, the plans of school houses and grounds, and the description
                  of furniture, recently published in Canada, Nova Scotia, and the United States,
                  and should exert his best efforts to aid the School Committees in making
                  selections and arrangements proportionate to the money to be expended.<note

               <p TEIform="p">It is probable that many people in the province lauded the Government
                  for passing a School Act which spared property owners the <q rend="inline"
                     direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">burden</q> of taxation for schools. Others,
                  however, were disappointed that the Government should continue to temporize. At a
                  public meeting held in Carleton on March 16, 1859, for the purpose of considering
                  the adoption of the assessment principle, one of the speakers pointed to the
                  United States, Upper Canada, Scotland, and Germany as instances of the beneficial
                  working of this principle. <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">He
                     could only condemn the Government for not making it compulsory (in New
                     Brunswick). He thought they should have had the moral courage to grapple with
                     the question of Education, and have firmly determined to stand or fall by
                     direct taxation for the support of schools throughout the Province.</q>

                  schools, and about 13,000 a year for denominational institutions. Why not, asked
                  The Morning News, introduce a bill embracing what was required, and submit it to

                  question again. There were ample opportunities for asking it, for no further steps
                  were taken in the direction of free tax-supported schools until 1871. If, as a
                  writer to <hi rend="italic" TEIform="hi">The Courier</hi> said in 1862,<note
                     target="n8.52" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">52</hi>
                  </note> the majority of the members of the Assembly were convinced of the benefits
                  which would result from the adoption of such a system, then one is justified in
                  concluding that the members hesitated because they knew there was no popular
                  demand for it. This indifference of the people meant that eventually a system of
                  free tax-supported schools had to be imposed from above, rather than achieved as
                  the result of a popular movement. That the establishment of municipal
                  institutions, and, to a certain extent, of responsible government, took place in
                  much the same way is indicative of consistency, but only adds to the enigma of the
                  New Brunswick civic temperament of a hundred years ago.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">During the decade between 1860 and 1870, absorbing problems involving
                  railways, industry, Maritime Union, and Confederation were before the province.
                  This fact possibly explains the paucity of educational developments during that
                  interval, and the postponement of a free school act. The report of the Chief
                  Superintendent of Education in 1868 indicated that the cause of education had been
                  influenced adversely by the problems and disturbances of the times. The year 1867
                  had been eventful in the history of the Province. The distraction of the popular
                  mind arising from the political agitations and changes, the depressed state of
                  business, the diminished demand for labour in the principal centres, were all
                  calculated, he said, to draw men's minds from the subject <pb n="172" id="p172"
                     TEIform="pb"/> of education. He added: <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified"
                     TEIform="q">Whatever may be the effect of these influences in the future, it is
                     morally certain that their tendency for the time was rather to retard than to
                     advance the interests of education</q>.<note target="n8.53" anchored="yes"
                     TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">53</hi>
                  </note> But for this negative influence, it is difficult to find a vital
                  connection between the political and economic developments of the period, and the
                  educational question. In a sense, the fact that the Province came to maturity
                  educationally, as well as politically, establishes a relationship among all the
                  events and developments of the era. We shall not, however, strain a point to
                  discover a more significant interaction.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">In addition to the difficulty of establishing a close relationship
                  between education and Confederation, there is another reason why a lengthy
                  consideration of the political aspects of the decade would be superfluous in this
                  study. No period of Maritime and Canadian history has received so much attention
                  from writers. Economists, royal commissions, and advocates of Maritime Rights have
                  familiarized us with the chief features of the Golden Age, and have discussed the
                  reasons for its decline. Historians have found in the pre-Confederation period
                  ample material for article and essay. The history of the movement which led to
                  Confederation has been told, from its beginnings in the rather nebulous ideas in
                  the minds of Guy Carleton and William Smith at the time of the disruption of the
                  Old Empire, through a number of proposals for various kinds of union&#8212;regional,
                  legislative, federated&#8212;down to the consummation of the idea in the British
                  North America Act.<note target="n8.54" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

                  influence of the American Civil War, of the Trent affair, and of Fenian threats,
                  has been recognized. The key position of New Brunswick in relation to the scheme,
                  the part played by her governors for and against union, and the political
                  manoeuvres which led to a reconsideration of the question in the province are not
                  unexplored topics.<note target="n8.57" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

                  Government which had sponsored the Act of 1858 dismissed Marshall d'Avray from his
                  post as Chief Superintendent. A descend- <pb n="173" id="p173" TEIform="pb"/> ant
                  of his family has said that he lost his position 'through the precipitate action
                  of a group of politicians who then autocratically managed affairs, under what has
                  been somewhat impolitely called The Smasher Government'.<note target="n8.58"
                     anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">58</hi>
                  </note> It is not clear whether the Government objected to d'Avray's political
                  views, his educational policies, or his dual role as Chief Superintendent and
                  Professor of Modern Languages at King's College. Patronage may have been a factor,
                  for the new incumbent of the office was Henry Fisher, a brother of Charles Fisher,
                  the leader of the Government. Indeed, this may have been the real reason, since a
                  number of other public officials were dismissed at the same time in accordance
                  with the <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">spoils system</q> which
                  was then so generally practised in the neighbouring States as well as in other
                  provinces of British America.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">An untimely death made the new Superintendent's tenure of office so
                  brief that no accurate estimate can be made of his views, or of his abilities as
                  an administrator. His first&#8212;and last&#8212;report shows that he entered into his
                  work with energy, and was making a study of educational developments elsewhere. In
                  accordance with the Act of 1858 he had made a series of visits to all the
                  counties, delivering lectures on education. He referred to physical education as a
                  subject under the consideration of some of the leading educationists of the day,
                  and hoped to mature a plan by which it might be introduced into New Brunswick. He
                  had similar hopes with regard to the study of vocal music, which, he said, was
                  proving advantageous on the Continent, in Great Britain, the United States, and
                  some of the neighboring provinces. The pupil-teachers at the Training School were
                  already receiving instruction in the subject. He believed that intercourse for
                  purposes of mutual sympathy and improvement would be helpful to teachers, and he
                  pointed to the establishment of Teachers' Institutes in the United States, Canada,
                  and Nova Scotia. After consultation with the inspectors he had resolved to attempt
                  similar establishments in the Province. On the subject of assessment he adopted a
                  cautious tone, which is not surprising considering his close connection with the
                  leader of the Government which had failed to make assessment for schools
                  compulsory. His belief was, he said, that the Legislature had been wise in 1852
                  and 1858 in leaving the assessment principle to voluntary action. The subject was
                  now being discussed in the Press, at meetings, and in homes. He was optimistic
                  that in a few years the country would be ready for the general adoption of the
                     system.<note target="n8.59" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">59</hi>
                  </note> One wonders how long he would have maintained this spirit of optimism had
                  he lived.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">Fisher was succeeded by John Bennet who remained in office until the
                  inauguration of the free school system rendered advisable the appointment of a man
                  experienced in its workings. Such an individual was found in the person of
                  Theodore Rand of Nova Scotia.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">Among the changes in personnel which took place after the passing of
                  the Act of 1858, we note that E. H. Duval resigned as master of the Training <pb
                     n="174" id="p174" TEIform="pb"/> School to become one of the provincial
                  inspectors. He was succeeded by William Mills, who for some years previous had
                  conducted a <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">Commercial and
                     Mathematical School</q>, at his home on Coburg Street. On his appointment,
                  Mills arranged the transfer of the Normal School to his own premises, using the
                  pupils of the Commercial School as a Model School. Because of lack of space he
                  placed the female section of the Normal School in another building, under the
                  tutelage of Miss Duval, who had assisted her father.<note target="n8.60"
                     anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">60</hi>
                  </note> Later a move was made to premises a little more convenient, but <q
                     rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">not so commodious as might be

               </p>

               <p TEIform="p">The arrangement far from satisfactory at any time, became more
                  unsatisfactory as the attendance grew and the premises deteriorated. In 1870 a
                  Committee of the Board of Education visited the School and reported on the
                  unsuitability of the accommodations. Part of the Normal School was conducted in
                  the basement of Calvin Church on Hazen Street. The lighting, heating, and
                  ventilation were defective&#8212;for instance, one small stove heated three rooms.
                  The Female Department was lodged on Mill's own premises over a fuel shed, and the
                  skylight for ventilation in the centre of the roof was not water-tight.<note

                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">62</hi>
                  </note> Clearly, better accommodations would have to be provided. Moreover, for
                  some time Bennet had been urging the removal of the Normal School to Fredericton,
                  where the Superintendent, the chief agent of the Board of Education, had his
                  office and could exercise supervision without expenditures for travel. One central
                  Training School would, he thought, render unnecessary the supplementary school
                  conducted at Chatham for the benefit of the northern counties.<note target="n8.63"

               </p>

               <p TEIform="p">This school at Chatham was under the management of William Crocket who
                  was a native of Scotland and had attended Aberdeen College. After acting as
                  Principal of the Superior School at Campbellton he had become the head of the
                  Presbyterian Academy at Chatham. When he began to train teachers he used this
                  Academy as his Model School. His report of 1870 shows that during the three years
                  his Training School was in operation he trained 117 candidates.<note
                     target="n8.64" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">64</hi>
                  </note> Professional instruction, as we noted earlier, was given after the regular
                  school hours.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">The availability of the stone barracks on Queen Street, Fredericton,
                  at a rental of £ 10 sterling per annum, facilitated the move from Saint John to
                  that city. Although sixteen years had passed since the Commission of 1854 had
                  urged the importance of fine buildings and grounds for a Normal School, temporary
                  housing accommodations for the Training School of New Brunswick were not to end in
                  1870. The first Normal School had been conducted in a gaol. The move at this time
                  from a basement and a semi-loft was made to the stone barracks in Fredericton,
                  where the new school opened in May, 1870, under the Principalship of William
                  Crocket. Not until 1877 was a really suitable <pb n="175" id="p175" TEIform="pb"/>
                  building, designed for the purpose, constructed on the site of the present Normal
                  School.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">From the official reports of the sixties we learn that candidates
                  entering the Training School were found to be better prepared than formerly. The
                  Superintendent thought that this was due to the <q rend="inline"
                     direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">improving quality</q> of the common schools,
                  and the practice of rejecting candidates who were not qualified.<note

                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">65</hi>
                  </note> In 1863 the system was begun of requiring teachers, at the expiration of
                  their training, to undergo examination in writing for their license. The
                  superintendent commended this, but pointed out that licenses issued under the old
                  system did not represent the same qualifications as licenses under the new system.
                  Because of this inequality, he thought that a reclassification of licenses was
                     necessary.<note target="n8.66" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">66</hi>
                  </note> This, however, does not seem to have been done.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">The number of trained teachers greatly increased during this period.
                  In 1868 there were twice as many trained teachers as in 1858, and the
                  Superintendent expressed the doubt that any state in the American Union had its
                  schools conducted by so large a proportion of trained teachers as New Brunswick.
                  He believed that Massachusetts might shortly adopt a training policy like that of
                  New Brunswick's, in preference to the Teachers' Institutes on which, in that
                  state, dependence had so long been placed. Even Nova Scotia, to which many anxious
                  eyes were turned for educational light,<note target="n8.67" anchored="yes"
                     TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">67</hi>
                  </note> was, in this respect, behind New Brunswick in actual and relative number
                  of trained teachers employed in the public schools. In New Brunswick, two out of
                  every three teachers were trained; in Nova Scotia in 1867 not more than two
                  hundred and seventy-two teachers were graduates of the Normal School.<note
                     target="n8.68" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">68</hi>
                  </note> There were, however, still too many untrained teachers in New Brunswick,
                  and the Superintendent suggested that the Board of Education, after giving notice,
                  should require all untrained teachers to attend the Training School or submit to
                     re-examination.<note target="n8.69" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">69</hi>
                  </note> He thought that if teachers did not possess the qualifications which the
                  law and the age required, in mercy to the public they should be made to stand
                  aside, and if they possessed those qualifications, there was no hardship in asking
                  them to submit proof.<note target="n8.70" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">70</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>

               <p TEIform="p">In connection with this question of untrained teachers it would appear
                  that these were of two classes&#8212;teachers who were granted third class licenses
                  on the recommendation of the inspector, and students who were recommended by the
                  principals of the better schools of the province, and were examined for license by
                  a Board of Examiners, without being required to attend the Normal School. From the
                  Minutes of the Board of Education under the date of April 12, 1860, we find that
                  the Board had had enquiries from St. Stephen Academy and Sackville Academy
                  relative to this question, and that the Board refused to <pb n="176" id="p176"
                     TEIform="pb"/> make a blanket regulation, but ruled that each case would be
                  dealt with according to its own merits.<note target="n8.71" anchored="yes"

               </p>

               <p TEIform="p">From the number of misdemeanors and irregularities of various kinds
                  reported against teachers during this period, one is induced to wonder if the
                  economic uncertainties, political unease, and international tensions of the early
                  sixties had not communicated to society a social restlessness and a disregard of
                  standards. A simpler explanation may lie in the fact that after the Act of 1858
                  personal and professional mistakes of the teaching profession were more likely to
                  be noted and reported, because of a better system of inspection. At any rate, many
                  irregularities were reported during this period. A surprising number of teachers
                  lost their licenses for drunkenness, irregular attendance, and immoral or abusive
                  language. Of the more flagrant cases we shall note a few specific examples. In
                  1862 two male teachers lost their licenses because they were charged with
                  seduction and bastardy,<note target="n8.72" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">72</hi>
                  </note> and two female teachers also had their licenses cancelled because they had
                  given birth to illegitimate children.<note target="n8.73" anchored="yes"
                     TEIform="note">

                  </note> In the same year, a teacher was charged with drunkenness, altering his
                  license from the third class to the second, and forging the signatures of the
                  trustees to some school returns.<note target="n8.74" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">74</hi>
                  </note> The next year, Inspector Duval reported that a teacher, or his wife, was
                  selling liquor on the premises where the school was conducted, viz., in a part of
                  the teacher's house, and that at the time of the inspector's visit there were
                  parties drinking and quarreling about the said premises.<note target="n8.75"
                     anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">75</hi>
                  </note> At one session of the Board of Education in the spring of 1865, the
                  license of one teacher was cancelled because he had made false returns, and that
                  of another likewise, because full investigation had upheld charges that he had
                  indulged in improper conduct towards some of his female pupils.<note

               <p TEIform="p">Evidences of professional, as well as of moral lapses, occur in some
                  of the inspectors' reports. One official remarked that he did not wonder there
                  were wretched schools, for he sometimes had entered a school to find the master
                  poring over a newspaper or the mistress engaged at a quilt.<note target="n8.77"

                  </note> In the course of observations in 1870 on the school book question,
                  Inspector Morrison revealed some interesting facts both about the texts and the
                  way in which they were sometimes handled by the teachers. After noting that the
                  only Geography used in the French Schools taught that the population of St.
                  Andrews was 10,500 and that of Fredericton 5,300, he told of visiting a school in
                  Northumberland County where the children were reading a lesson from one of the
                  Irish National texts. The lesson began: <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified"
                     TEIform="q">The country where you, children, live in, is called Ireland</q>,
                  and the teacher gave the explanations all on the assumption that the children did
                  live in that country. The class was dismissed without any reference to the error,
                  and, on examination, the inspector found that the children <pb n="177" id="p177"
                     TEIform="pb"/> actually believed they lived in Ireland. The inspector's comment
                  was that it was bad enough to teach little Frenchmen that St. Andrew's was twice
                  the size of Fredericton, but that to teach young Bluenoses that they lived in

               <p TEIform="p">While hundreds of teachers were no doubt leading exemplary private and
                  professional lives, the number and nature of all these irregularities cast a
                  serious reflection on the character of the teaching body and indirectly, on the
                  provincial society which, through indifference or poverty, had failed to demand a
                  higher standard on the part of its teachers.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">We may note two other cases, of a somewhat different category. The
                  first of these was more pathetic than reprehensible. In 1862 the Board had before
                  it, for consideration, the case of a teacher from Albert County who asked for
                  provincial aid for five and five-eighths months of teaching service, when,
                  according to the regulations, no teacher could draw the provincial allowance for
                  less than six months of service. The teacher was well recommended by her employers
                  and by the trustees, but the Board noted that she was <q rend="inline"
                     direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">about twelve years of age</q>, and ruled <q
                     rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">Impossible to entertain such an

                  </note>
               </p>

               <p TEIform="p">The international situation was involved in the case of a teacher from
                  Campobello, whose application for the provincial grant was refused because he had
                  been for some time engaged in the service of the Federal Army during the American
                  Civil War. The order of the Board read as follows: <q rend="inline"
                     direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">Mr. D&#8212;&#8212;having openly violated the law, and
                     rendered himself liable to severe penalties by entering without license a
                     foreign service, cannot possibly be employed by the provincial government.</q>

               </p>

               <p TEIform="p">An excursion at this point into the economic, political, and social
                  fields seems necessary in order to accentuate the background into which this
                  rather depressing picture of pre-Confederation education in New Brunswick fits
                  with a remarkable degree of harmony. In this connection we find various
                  observations by Lieutenant-Governor A. H. Gordon of great significance. This
                  administrator, being young, vigorous, and without family cares, travelled the
                  remote rural areas of the province to a greater extent than had his
                     predecessors.<note target="n8.81" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">81</hi>
                  </note> He was, therefore, qualified to speak of prevailing conditions. Even the
                  possibility that his political observations may have been influenced by class and
                  political prejudices cannot rob them of significance.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">In 1862 Gordon made the following comparison between New Brunswick and
                  Canada: <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">Above all I have been
                     struck by the startling contrast which the position of New Brunswick presents
                     to that of the neighboring province of Canada. New Brunswick viewed after an
                     inspection however cursory of the wealth, prosperity, comfort and progress of
                     that magnificent dependency appears poverty-stricken, stagnant and decaying. In
                     Canada new buildings are everywhere rising which in the towns are generally of
                     brick or stone; new <pb n="178" id="p178" TEIform="pb"/> settlements are
                     extending in the wilderness on well organized plans: ships crowd every port of
                     their noble rivers and lakes. Here, new buildings, almost always of wood,
                     certainly creep up here or there; but a stone house or public building is a
                     sure mark of an earlier period; new settlements are few: but two or three, on
                     any plan or scale, of numbering so many as fifty persons having been mad, in
                     the last ten years, whilst the bare sad desolation of cleared land once farmed
                     but now abandoned is not an infrequent spectacle in any extensive journey, and
                     I know of at least one settlement, where twenty years ago there were one
                     hundred settlers, and now are none.</q>

               </p>

               <p TEIform="p">It is significant that a recent economist should have to describe the
                  rural New Brunswick of today in terms reminiscent of those used by Gordon eighty
                  years ago. On the other hand, if this description of conditions of eighty years
                  ago is accurate, it indicates that the prosperity connected in the Popular mind
                  with the pre-Confederation era has been somewhat overrated.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">Gordon next referred to the apathetic listlessness of the inhabitants,
                     <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">a listlessness which
                     contrasts strongly with the notions usually entertained of the American
                     character, and which is partly the cause and partly the result of the present
                     political conditions of the Province&#8212;partly the cause&#8212;as but for their
                     own apathy and inefficiency the educated and wealthy class would not so wholly
                     have lost every vestige of influence; partly the result, for under the existing
                     state of things no man of comfortable private means has any temptation to busy
                     himself with public affairs</q>.<note target="n8.83" anchored="yes"

                     were lavished on the elections. Members are not ashamed to boast openly, and at
                     my table, of the amount they have expended. I have myself heard a member of the
                     Executive Council boast to one of his colleagues that his supporters had cost
                     him a guinea apiece, and that their votes were not to be had at 3s. 6d. a head,

                     and mournfully endeavouring to avoid the sofa cushions pitched about the House
                     by playful and would be humorous members, was highly suggestive of the change
                     which the last five and twenty years have worked in the character and
                     appearance of the Assembly.</q> He attributed this state of affairs partly to

               <p TEIform="p">While in Gordon's remarks of a somewhat similar nature two years later
                  we may trace signs of his opposition at that time to Confederation, it is
                  impossible to believe that they are completely devoid of significance. Under the
                  date of October 11, 1864, he pointed out that in a Federal System the ablest men
                  in political life would be found at the political centre, leaving little material
                  for an able Executive and Legislature in the provinces, especially in New
                  Brunswick, where there was a lack of material to begin with. <q rend="inline"

                     few consecutive lines, and utterly unable to do so consistently with any known
                     rules of grammar or orthography&#8212;men, not only without principle, but without
                     the affectation of principle, men whose honesty . . . consists in their open
                     avowal of selfish motives and the unconcealed manner in which they exercise any
                     power they may possess to profit themselves or their friends, or to injure
                     those against whom they may have a grudge.</q>

               <p TEIform="p">This picture of men and things, even after allowances are made for
                  possible exaggerations and misinterpretations on Gordon's part, is revealing. One
                  sees defective educational facilities as both cause and effect&#8212;as the result of
                  years of rule by <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">gentlemen</q>
                  insufficiently concerned with the needs of the common people; and as the cause, or
                  at least one of the causes, of laggard developments in education after the reins
                  had passed from the hands of <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q"
                     >gentlemen</q>. These found much to condemn in the new order, but failed to see
                  that their fathers and grandfathers were partly responsible.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">Turning now to the more promising aspects of education in the sixties
                  we find a number of improvements and advances. As we have seen, the Grammar
                  Schools of the province, from the first, were under the management of separate
                  Boards of Trustees or Directors. In 1861 they were placed under the control of the
                  Board of Education, and became subject to the supervision of the <pb n="180"
                     id="p180" TEIform="pb"/> Chief Superintendent. Of the eleven Grammar Schools
                  which he visited in 1861 and 1862, he reported four as good, three as middling,
                  and the remainder as below the grade of the ordinary Parish Schools.<note
                     target="n8.89" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">89</hi>
                  </note> In an effort to raise the standard of these schools, the Board of
                  Education issued a number of regulations. In future no person would be considered
                  eligible to take charge of any of the Grammar Schools who was not a graduate of
                  some degree-conferring university or college, or who had not received a
                  certificate of qualification upon examination before the Board. The school house
                  was to be fully equipped and large enough to allow not less than 120 cubic feet of
                  air to each pupil. There must be an average daily attendance of not less than
                  fifteen pupils over ten years of age, and at least five pupils in each Grammar
                  School were to be regularly instructed in Latin. Greek and Mathematics, or any two
                  of these branches, and not less than ten in English Composition and Modern
                     History.<note target="n8.90" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

                  </note> Grammar School licenses continued to be issued by the Lieutenant-Governor
                  in Council, and in the Minutes of the Council we find references to a number of
                  applications during this period. These licenses seem to have been granted without
                  an examination of the candidate, but whether or not the applicant in every case
                  held a degree is not stated. In 1865 Superintendent Bennet referred to the
                  disadvantage of having the Grammar Schools and the district schools under separate
                  Boards of Trustees. He said that sometimes big boys were sent to the district
                  schools, and small ones to the Grammar Schools, thus reversing the order of things
                  and making the schools to some extent do each other's work.<note target="n8.91"

                  </note> As we shall see, the Act of 1871 permitted the joint management of both
                  types of schools, but not until 1884 were the separate Grammar School corporations
                  dissolved by law.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">Among the devices used during this decade to stimulate interest in
                  education were competitive examinations among the brighter pupils of a County.
                  According to the Superintendent's report in 1868 such examinations were first held
                  in Restigouche County in 1866, and had extended to Albert, Northumberland, and
                  part of Gloucester. The Government had aided the scheme by a grant of $ 40 to each
                  County for prizes, but sufficient funds for the prizes required had been
                  subscribed in those Counties by interested gentlemen before the Government took
                  action. The Government grant had been accepted, however, and the local funds
                  reserved for future competitions. Apparently great interest was aroused. A
                  competition held at Belledune between the champions of Restigouche and Gloucester
                  had been attended, said the Superintendent, by people from miles around.<note

                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">92</hi>
                  </note> The next report, however, expressed disappointment, for the new Government
                  was not prepared to make provision for the necessary prizes. Because dependence
                  had been placed on the expected grant, steps had not been taken in time to procure
                  funds from other sources. As a result, competi- <pb n="181" id="p181" TEIform="pb"
                  /> tive examinations had been repeated only in Restigouche and Gloucester, where
                  the necessary arrangements had been made the year before. The Superintendent
                  hopefully left the matter to the good sense and patriotism of the Government and
                     Legislature,<note target="n8.93" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">93</hi>
                  </note> and in May of that year the Executive Council issued a warrant to Bennet
                  for $ 200 on this account.<note target="n8.94" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">94</hi>
                  </note> The grant was apparently repeated the next year, as in March of 1870,
                  during a debate in the Assembly on another matter, one of the members urged that
                  it be struck off, as the benefits were not equal to the expenditure. He thought
                  that teachers were apt to give too great a share of their attention to two or
                  three pupils, in order to qualify them for the examination.<note target="n8.95"

               <p TEIform="p">Early in the sixties Teachers' Institutes were initiated; in fact
                  several regional Institutes were held before 1860, a number being reported in that
                  year as having been organized by the late Henry Fisher. <note target="n8.96"

                  </note> The first Provincial Institute was held in 1863. The modest scale on which
                  these early meetings were held is indicated by the attendance at the second annual
                  session, held in Fredericton in 1864. There were only twenty of the leading
                  teachers of the province present, besides the Chief Superintendent and three
                     inspectors.<note target="n8.97" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">97</hi>
                  </note> A degree of public interest in these Institutes, County and Provincial, is
                  revealed by grateful references on the part of the Superintendent and inspectors
                  to the offers of steamship companies, whose boats plied the Saint John river, to
                  convey the delegates at half price. That the collective body of teachers began
                  early to make suggestions to the Government in the interests of education is
                  indicated by a Minute of the Executive Council in 1867 acknowledging the receipt
                  of a letter from a committee of the Teachers' Provincial Institute. The Council
                  went on record as being interested always in obtaining information on the
                  important subject of education; thanked the teachers; and invited future
                     suggestions.<note target="n8.98" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">98</hi>
                  </note> It is fairly safe to suppose that the suggestions offered on this occasion
                  related to the subject of assessment.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">Towards the close of the decade, the Superintendent began to advocate
                  the establishment of a pension fund for teachers, pointing to the existence of
                  pension plans in Germany and in both provinces of Canada. He believed that a
                  scheme of pensions would be an inducement to young men to enter the school service
                  and to remain in it, and he thought it was mistaken economy to retain a man as
                  teacher after his mental and physical energies were impaired.<note target="n8.99"

               <p TEIform="p">From the official reports we glean a few minor items of information,
                  more or less interesting, or indicative of progress. The Superintendent reported
                  in 1862 that 5000 copies of Johnston's Catechism of Agricultural Chemistry and
                  Geology had been distributed for sale among the school book agents of the <pb
                     n="182" id="p182" TEIform="pb"/> province. He recommended this as a step toward
                  the improvement of agriculture. Special Agricultural Schools with Model Farms
                  attached were as yet too expensive for the province, but it was well to use
                  whatever modest means and humble appliances were at public disposal.<note

               </p>

               <p TEIform="p">We learn that a map of the Province was now available, and was offered
                  gratis to every school district which established a library of the minimum value
                  of £ 7 10s., including the Provincial bonus.<note target="n8.101" anchored="yes"

                  </note> The Board had made arrangements for the sale of Worcester's Series of
                  English Dictionaries which teachers might obtain at a discount of 25%. Bennet
                  approved of these as being free of the innovations which detracted from Webster's
                     Dictionary.<note target="n8.102" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

                  </note> In general, there were few authorized changes in the school books in use,
                  but a feeling was growing in favor of more modern texts. As Inspector Morrison
                  pointed out in 1866, a quarter of a century had elapsed since the readers had been
                  authorized, and school literature in the interval had improved, while succeeding
                  editions of the Irish National texts had deteriorated. In some of the
                  denominational schools obtaining provincial grants, books of a strong
                  denominational bias had been substituted, and along the border, teachers, sensible
                  of the inferiority of New Brunswick texts, were using the American books. This was
                  regarded as objectionable, as many of these books satirized British usages and
                     institutions.<note target="n8.103" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </p>

               <p TEIform="p">In 1871 the Superintendent reported that the Board had arranged with a
                  Toronto firm for readers to replace the Irish readers. These, he said, were
                  inexpensive, and were considered by teachers and clergymen to be well adapted to
                  schools of a mixed character.<note target="n8.104" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">104</hi>
                  </note> In the same year, Inspector Morrison expressed himself strongly on the
                  subject of French texts, severely criticizing those in use in the French schools.
                  He said that if it were expedient to preserve the French language at all in the
                  public schools, which many intelligent Frenchmen denied&#8212;a remarkable statement,
                  surely&#8212;then it was only wisdom and justice to afford the French children as
                  good facilities for obtaining information as were afforded to the English
                  children. In point of fact, however, catechisms and a few other religious books
                  formed nearly the whole literature of the French schools. The low state of these
                  schools was not always the result of poverty or indifference on the part of the
                  parents, but was chiefly caused, he thought, by the use of unsuitable books, and
                  the mistaken kindness hitherto extended to the French in not insisting upon higher
                  qualification in their teachers.<note target="n8.105" anchored="yes"
                     TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">105</hi>
                  </note> This last was evidently a reference to the fact that French teachers were
                  not required to attend the Training School. The year before, Morrison, at that
                  time the Inspector for Kent, Northumberland, Gloucester, and Restigouche, had
                  expressed the belief that the time had come when French teachers should be
                  required to attend that institution, and to pass the same tests as were applied to
                  other teachers. Their teach- <pb n="183" id="p183" TEIform="pb"/> ing power, he
                  said, was of the feeblest.<note target="n8.106" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">106</hi>
                  </note> The Superintendent had referred to the same subject in his report of 1867,
                  suggesting that the services of a French teacher competent in both languages
                  should be secured for the Training School, and that no licenses should be granted
                  to French applicants without attendance at the School.<note target="n8.107"

                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">107</hi>
                  </note> However, nothing was done in this connection during this period.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">Among the matters complained of by the Superintendent and inspectors,
                  nothing was mentioned more frequently than the number of small and unnecessary
                  schools. We must bear in mind that even the town schools were not yet graded.
                  Moreover, the vast majority were held in cramped quarters&#8212;an attic, a basement,
                  a room in the teacher's home, etc. There were also many educational agencies, all
                  independent of one another, and sometimes definitely antagonistic. Often in the
                  same community or area there were a Grammar School, a common school, a Madras
                  School, or some other denominational school. Even in the country, school districts
                  were often divided, and unnecessary schools established, through rivalry of
                  faction. These <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">fledglings</q>,
                  as the Superintendent called them in 1866, were but poor affairs. They reduced the
                  level of the schools of the province and saddled the country with useless
                     expense.<note target="n8.108" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">108</hi>
                  </note> In 1871 he declared that if Fredericton should have half a dozen new
                  schools, the addition would be actually a mischief, because schools were too
                  numerous there already. The same, he said, was true of other towns and
                     villages.<note target="n8.109" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">109</hi>
                  </note> From this, it emerges that the considerable increase in the number of
                  schools during this decade was not so completely that sign of progress which it
                  appeared to be, since many of the schools would have been unnecessary if a system
                  of gradation had been employed, and if school districts had been properly marked
                  off. In 1862, the Board, with a list before it of ninety schools having an average
                  attendance of less than ten pupils, did make an effort to discourage multiplicity
                  of schools of this type, by ordering that the daily average attendance in rural
                  schools must be at least ten, and in the cities, towns, and villages at least
                  seventeen, to entitle the teachers of such schools to the provincial allowance.
                  Teachers were also required to attest to the accuracy of their returns by
                  affidavit made before a Justice of the Peace.<note target="n8.110" anchored="yes"
                     TEIform="note">

                  </note> Both before and after this date a number of cases occurred in which
                  teachers were charged with having forged the names of the Trustees to school
                  returns. In one case the comment of the Board was: <q rend="inline"
                     direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">Returns grossly false</q> and <q rend="inline"
                     direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">cooked up</q>

                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">111</hi>
                  </note> Because of the large number of petitions from teachers who became
                  ineligible for the government allowance on account of the regulation of 1862 the
                  rule was relaxed in 1863. In districts where the number of resident children
                  between the ages of 16 and 6, years did exceed 15, the regulation would not be
                  enforced should the Inspector recommend its relaxation.<note target="n8.112"

                  of laying off suitable school districts.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">One matter on which the Superintendent expressed regret was the small
                  number of girls in attendance at the parish schools, as compared with the number
                  of boys. In his report for the year 1869, he drew attention to the fact that
                  during the winter term the attendance of boys exceeded that of girls by 3598, and
                  during the next term the excess was 2,006. It was his belief, he said, that the
                  sure hope of general instruction even for boys would never be realized until
                  general instruction was first secured for girls. The children of instructed and
                  enlightened mothers were almost certain to be instructed and enlightened also.
                  Universal female education was a prior and indispensable condition for the
                  establishment and perpetuity of a system of universal education for both
                     sexes.<note target="n8.113" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">113</hi>
                  </note> Although the Superintendent did not do so at the time, he might have
                  referred to the teaching profession in this connection. Since the retention of
                  male teachers in the teaching service was growing steadily more difficult, females
                  were staffing the schools in an increasing degree, therefore a supply of more and
                  better teachers was contingent on the spread of female education.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">The slowness with which communities availed themselves of the
                  opportunity to choose School Committees was also a matter of regret to the
                  Superintendent and inspectors. In 1866 Bennet reported that more than half the
                  schools were still without such Committees.<note target="n8.114" anchored="yes"
                     TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">114</hi>
                  </note> It may be that lack of power on the part of School Committees to raise
                  funds to make needed improvements, except for School Libraries, promoted a general
                  feeling that such Committees could not render services commensurate with the
                  trouble of electing them,<note target="n8.115" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">115</hi>
                  </note> but obviously local disinterest was largely responsible. The failure of
                  the majority of school districts to adopt the assessment principle was another
                  indication of this same indifference. Sometimes the absence of provisions for a
                  bonus to counties adopting the principle was cited as a deterrent, an excuse which
                  suggests the existence of a feeling of unwillingness to accept a duty without
                  payment for the performance of that duty.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">That the Superintendent and inspectors supported the idea of
                  compulsory assessment is indicated by many of their remarks. In 1861 the
                  Superintendent declared that one might as well ask the dumb to sing as to wait
                  until the indifferent had cast off their apathy. The success of assessment in
                  Canada and elsewhere should influence New Brunswick to make the experiment. There
                  was much juvenile depravity in Saint John. While he commended the establishment of
                  a Reformatory School, he thought that the outlay it required would not have been
                  necessary if the money had been spent years before in opening Free Schools for the
                  poor and friendless. Schoolmasters were the cheapest and most effective
                     police.<note target="n8.116" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">116</hi>

               </p>

               <p TEIform="p">In 1867 Inspector Freeze said that one would think that the people of
                     <pb n="185" id="p185" TEIform="pb"/> New Brunswick, with such activity and
                  improvements in education on all sides of them, would awake to a lively sense of
                  the condition of their young, and would at once demand of their rulers greater
                  progress. Referring to the neighboring republic, to Canada, and to Nova Scotia, he
                  asked: <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">How is it that New
                     Brunswick is doomed 'to drag her slow length along', and to allow the adjacent
                     States and Provinces to lead, yes more, to outstrip her in the race of
                     educational improvement?</q> Placing the responsibility more boldly on the
                  Legislature than was usually done in these reports, he said that the Province
                  required a new and vigorous measure that would compel assessment for schools, open
                  the schools freely to every child of suitable age, and compel attendance at
                  school. If there was ever a time when the Statesmen of New Brunswick could be a
                  blessing to their country and could leave themselves a name on the pages of
                  history, it was at that moment, when the people were anxiously awaiting a bold and
                  vigorous School Law that would give new life to study, and to the aspirations of
                  the young, and would create a determination on the part of the people to raise the
                  educational status of the Province, making it equal, if not superior, to that of

               <p TEIform="p">Others besides the educational officials of the Province labored
                  during this period to arouse public interest and to spur the Legislature into
                  action. Of these propagandists, none is more worthy of notice than George Parkin,
                  during whose Principalship of the Grammar School at Bathurst, (1867-1871),
                  competitive examinations in Gloucester County were conducted with such marked
                  enthusiasm. In a lecture in 1868 in the Court House at Bathurst, Parkin, speaking
                  of the neglect of education, said: 'I do not believe that our politicians are such
                  blind fools that they cannot catch a glimpse of this fact, that they cannot
                  perceive the weakness of a political economy that takes so little account of the
                  mental resources of a nation, and hence one is forced to the inference that they
                  willingly sacrifice what they know to be the true and permanent interests of their
                  country for the accomplishment of such ends as will receive the richest reward of
                  vulgar popular applause'. Referring to the Lieutenant-Governor of New Brunswick,
                  L. A. Wilmot, and to Charles Tupper, Premier of Nova Scotia, he observed: 'It is
                  indeed cheering to behold such a man as our own Lieutenant-Governor throwing all
                  the weight of that influence which his fellow Provincialists have bestowed upon
                  him and all the power of his flowing eloquence into the scale of educational
                  progress, and to see Tupper of Nova Scotia staking his political reputation and
                  political life on the question of free public instruction'. He closed his lecture
                  with these words: 'It needs no prophet's eye to see that the day is not far
                  distant when the people of this Province will be asked to declare if they wish the
                  last barrier which separates the son of the poor man from the son of the rich man
                  to be broken down; if they desire to leave to their posterity the proud right of
                  boasting that every child born on the soil of <pb n="186" id="p186" TEIform="pb"/>
                  New Brunswick is as free to drink from the well of Knowledge as he is to breathe

               <p TEIform="p">As Parkin had said, all signs pointed to an impending change. The
                  Superintendent might admit a greater number of schools, an increased school

                  numbers of children who were not attending any kind of school. In his report for
                  1870 he stated that there were 279 schoolhouses not the property of the district.
                  Many of these were inferior and unsuitable.<note target="n8.122" anchored="yes"

                  </note> As for school attendance, Nova Scotia, with an estimated population of
                  392,562, had in 1869 a registered school attendance of 93,731. Estimating the
                  population of New Brunswick at about 300,000, the registered attendance in that
                  province should have been about 71,000, in place of which the minutest search
                  could find no more than 49,000. To do as well as Nova Scotia, New Brunswick should
                  have had 22,000 more children in school, and to do as well as she ought to do,
                  should have had still more, for in Nova Scotia in 1869 there were 15,000 children
                  of school age who were not attending school.<note target="n8.123" anchored="yes"

                  </note> Moreover, the average attendance of those who were enrolled was only 53.7%
                  for the winter term of 1870, and 52.5% for the summer term.<note target="n8.124"

                  </note> These facts indicated the necessity of a new method of school support. A
                  change with regard to inspection was also needed. For instance, Inspector Duval
                  had to supervise 270 schools, while in Ontario the law required no inspector to be
                  responsible for more than 120 schools.<note target="n8.125" anchored="yes"

               </p>

               <p TEIform="p">There were other factors. More than a decade had elapsed without any
                  significant school legislation. The Confederation issue was settled, and the
                  British North America Act, by making education a provincial responsibility, had
                  focussed attention in New Brunswick on educational developments in the other
                  provinces of the new Dominion. <note target="n8.126" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </p>

               <p TEIform="p">In this connection, the example of Ontario and of Nova Scotia was an
                  inspiration. In Ontario, although the Education Act of 1850 had left the matter of
                  assessment to the choice of the electors, Ryerson's propaganda and the growth of
                  an educational consciousness had led to an adoption of the principle on a scale
                  unknown in New Brunswick, so that an Act at this very time, 1871, making the
                  adoption of the assessment principle compulsory, and the schools free, met with no
                     opposition.<note target="n8.127" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

                  </note> In New Brunswick's neighbor, Nova Scotia, the leader of the Government,
                  Charles Tupper, had gained the concurrence of <pb n="187" id="p187" TEIform="pb"/>
                  A. G. Archibald, the leader of the Opposition, in 1864, and a Free School Act had
                  passed without serious opposition, although as in New Brunswick there was not a
                  little local hostility.<note target="n8.128" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </p>

               <p TEIform="p">In the Mother Country, also, the sixties had been marked by
                  considerable educational activity. The Newcastle Commission of 1861, the Clarendon
                  Commission on Secondary Schools in the same year, the Taunton Enquiry of 1864, the
                  Endowed Schools Act of 1869, had all led on to the forward step taken in the
                  Education Act of 1870, an Act which almost of necessity followed the increased
                  enfranchisement of the working classes in 1867. Although under the new Act
                  subsidies were continued to the denominational and other voluntary schools, there
                  was to be a closer supervision of those schools. The main feature of the Act,
                  however, was the provision for tax-supported, non-sectarian schools, or <q
                     rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">Board Schools</q>, as they came
                  to be called. While attendance was not made compulsory, unless the School Boards
                  adopted a by-law to that effect, and while the schools were not free except to the
                     indigent,<note target="n8.129" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">129</hi>
                  </note> the Act represented a great advance. These developments did not go
                  unnoticed in New Brunswick. Hannay tells us that many people, looking to the
                  Mother Country as an example to be imitated, argued that if Free Schools did not
                  exist there, New Brunswick did not need them.<note target="n8.130" anchored="yes"

                  </note> Others, however, realized how progressive a measure the British Education
                  Act was, relatively speaking, and hailed it as an inspiration. Inspector Duval,
                  penning his report in 1871, referred to the surprising enactment so noiselessly
                  made by the British Parliament during the previous year. <q rend="inline"

               <p TEIform="p">In the light of domestic conditions and potent external examples, the
                  framing of legislation which would improve the educational facilities of New
                  Brunswick was clearly one of the responsibilities facing the new administration
                  after the election of 1870. The speech from the throne, the reading of which must
                  have given Lieutenant-Governor Wilmot great satisfaction, foreshadowed school
                  legislation, referring to the need of a better school system. <q rend="inline"
                     direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">In comparison with this, all other questions
                     for Legislative deliberation are of secondary importance. It is the first duty
                     of the governing power to make provision for the education of every child. The
                     children of the poorest in our land should have free access to Schools, where
                     they can receive at least the rudiments of an education, that will qualify them
                     for an intelligent performance of their duties as citizens.</q>

                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">132</hi>
                  </note> Thus the Government indicated its intentions to deal at last with the
                  question of Free Schools.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">As Attorney-General King pointed out in the Assembly, the Bill could
                     <pb n="188" id="p188" TEIform="pb"/> not have taken anyone by surprise.
                  Following Hartley's resolution in 1868 the Government had prepared a bill which
                  got as far as being published. In 1870 another had been brought down, but was
                  withdrawn. Then had come the election in full view of the question. A constituency
                  could only blame itself if it had sent to the Assembly members not pledged on the
                  question one way or another. Taxation for schools was working in New England,
                  Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and on the Continent. In proposing the establishment
                  of the provisions of the Bill the Government was only doing what almost every
                  other civilized country had done for its people.<note target="n8.133"

               </p>

               <p TEIform="p">In some contradiction to this, an editorial in <hi rend="italic"
                     TEIform="hi">The Telegraph</hi> at the time the Legislature opened referred to
                  the fact that since the Bill of 1870 nothing had been done by the Government to
                  bring out public sentiment. There had been no public meetings, nothing except a
                  few speeches at the last session and one or two hustings speeches in which the
                  subject with a score of others had been briefly alluded to. It might be said that
                  the Superintendent had done something in public addresses to further the interests
                  of free unsectarian schools, <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">but
                     all who understand the small amount of influence which our Education Department
                     exerts in influencing public sentiment, will not be apt to over-estimate the
                     services of the Superintendent in this direction</q>. Perhaps, said <hi

                  a good School Bill was to result in an easy victory might account for the lack of

                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">135</hi>
                  </note> It would seem from these and other observations that while everyone was
                  more or less aware that a School Bill was in the offing, the subject had not been
                  made an issue in the election.</p>


               <p TEIform="p">Very early in the session the insecurity of the Government became
                  apparent. Before even the speech from the throne had been considered, the leader
                  of the Government, George E. King, announced the Government's resignation. Then
                  followed the announcement that George L. Hatheway of York County had been called
                  on to form a new administration which, when announced, was found to include the
                  majority of the previous Executive. The announcement of the King-Hatheway
                  coalition caused great excitement, as Hatheway, according to the story as told by

                     Morning Freeman</hi> as fairly representative of the two great sections of
                  opinion. The latter, however, dealt mainly with the denominational question which
                  was involved commenting but little on the other aspects of the Bill. <hi

                  entire course of the Bill with considerable attention.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">In commenting on the text of the measure, <hi rend="italic"
                     TEIform="hi">The Telegraph</hi> was generally approving, but noted the
                  composition of the Board of Education as one feature that might be improved. It
                  was right, declared the editor, that the President of the University should be a
                  member of the Board, if he could spare the time; right too, that the
                  Superintendent of Education should be; but should not the members be <q

                     versed in educational matters? . . . But what presumption is there that the

                     thoroughly conversant with educational matters? In this Province, at least,
                     literary or scientific attainments are no passport to political
                  distinction</q>. Even if the members of the Executive were qualified, could they
                  give the necessary time and attention to the duties of the Board? Moreover, they
                  were subject to distracting political influences, and, as a body, were subject to
                  frequent changes in personnel.<note target="n8.140" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

                  </note> We may note that Inspector Duval had said something of the same sort more
                  than ten years before. In 1869 he said that he had suggested as early as 1858 that
                  the Board of Education should not consist of the Executive Council, but should be
                  a group chosen to represent the different sections of the Province and the various
                  religious bodies. It should be composed of gentlemen who had given special
                  attention to popular education, had acquainted themselves with its great
                  principles, and were well informed on improved methods which had been successfully
                  adopted by intelligent teachers. The members of the Executive Council were not the
                  right men, <pb n="190" id="p190" TEIform="pb"/> in his estimation, for they were
                  chosen for political considerations, and to then, education was a secondary
                     matter.<note target="n8.141" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </p>

               <p TEIform="p">About a week after its earlier reference to this subject, <hi
                     rend="italic" TEIform="hi">The Telegraph</hi> reported that the
                  Attorney-General had discussed the matter very thoroughly in the Assembly. He
                  pointed out that in England the Board was composed of the members of the Privy
                  Council, and in Nova Scotia it was also political. In the United States it was
                  non-political, and also in the Upper Provinces of the Dominion, save that the
                  Minister of Public Instruction&#8212;a member of the ministry&#8212;was one of its
                  members. The Attorney-General did not think it was necessary that the Board should
                  be composed of men of profound scholastic attainments. A Superintendent competent
                  in that respect was all that was required. What was needed was a body of men of
                  fairly sound judgment and good business talent. If the Board were a non-political
                  body, composed of men from different parts of the province, the members would have
                  to receive large grants for contingent expenses for travelling. The probability
                  was that such a Board would be like the Board of the University of New Brunswick,
                  at which gentlemen held seats and were never known to attend a meeting. The
                  members of the Executive, on the other hand, were often called to Fredericton in
                  connection with government business. The duties of the Board, he said, were
                  largely administrative, therefore politics could not play a part, unless in the
                  case of the appointment of the inspectors. As for the changing character of the
                  Executive Council, the presence of the President of the University on the Board
                  would give a continuity of experience.<note target="n8.142" anchored="yes"
                     TEIform="note">

               </p>

               <p TEIform="p">These arguments, largely based on the practical considerations which
                  our investigations have revealed were always appealing to a New Brunswick
                  Legislature, proved convincing, and the composition of the Board of Education,
                  under the Act of 1871, continued as before, except for the addition of the
                  President of the University of New Brunswick. Educationally, the question may
                  still be a moot question, but otherwise it seems to have been written off as
                  closed.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">Of the debate on other features of the Bill, we may briefly note what
                  the Attorney-General said on the question of local control. Counties and parishes
                  had proved to be too large to be effective units of local government. There were
                  few municipalities in New Brunswick, therefore it was necessary to set up
                  districts. These, he said, would be small enough to put no child to the necessity
                  of walking more than two miles to school.<note target="n8.143" anchored="yes"
                     TEIform="note">

               </p>

               <p TEIform="p">During the debate, S. H. Napier of Bathurst created considerable
                  amusement when he began his speech in support of the Bill by holding up a copy of
                     <hi rend="italic" TEIform="hi">The Fourth Book of Lessons</hi> for the use of
                  schools, and, to show the character of the teaching under which the instruction of
                  his youth had been received, read out that the Province of New Brunswick was
                  composed of land and rivers, and most of it was covered by a forest composed of
                  trees, that people called lumber- <pb n="191" id="p191" TEIform="pb"/> men, who
                  lived in low log huts, went in pursuit of these trees, cut them down, and made
                  timber. The timber was floated to Fredericton and shipped in vessels to Halifax
                  where it was reshipped to England. For it the natives got in return cotton. This,
                  he said, was the kind of stuff he had been taught, and he thought that many of the
                  books then in use were not of a much higher or more accurate standard.<note

                     TEIform="hi">The Freeman</hi> had charged that for many years there had been a
                  deliberate and persistent attempt on the part of the Chief Superintendent and his
                  inspectors to decry the school system of the province. In all countries the
                  results of the existing system were put in the best possible light before the
                  world. Everywhere else, if a boy attended school for even one day, he was
                  numbered, whereas in New Brunswick this was not done, and the great object was to
                  prove that the attendance was less than it ought to be.<note target="n8.145"

               <p TEIform="p">Raymond has said that in view of the fact that public opinion in New
                  Brunswick had been against free schools up to this time, it was remarkable how
                  little opposition the Bill of 1871 encountered in the Assembly.<note

                  </note> It would seem, however, that several of the sessions were heated, for <hi
                     rend="italic" TEIform="hi">The Telegraph</hi> observed that the Speaker was a
                  gentleman, and was elected to preside over an assembly of gentlemen and not over a
                  bear-garden. Why, then, did he allow disgraceful scenes to occur?<note
                     target="n8.147" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">147</hi>
                  </note> It is possible, of course, that the acrimony and violent talk hinted at by
                     <hi rend="italic" TEIform="hi">The Telegraph</hi> were caused by the political
                  manoeuvres which had resulted in the King-Hatheway coalition, and not by the
                  School Bill. Actually, however, the manoeuvres and the measure were closely
                  associated, and in much of the wordy warfare in which the newspapers engaged we
                  find the two subjects closely linked.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">Whatever the feeling in the Legislature, there was clearly a spirit of
                  opposition in the province at large. An examination of the petitions which were
                  tabled at this session, and of those, too, which had been presented off and on for
                  many years previous, indicates that the popular opposition to the School Bill fell
                  into two classes. One group of people objected to taxation for schools; the other
                  was hostile to non-sectarian schools. The more vocal opposition came from the
                  latter group through their clerics and their journalists. There were 22 petitions
                  in 1871 for Separate or Dissentient Schools signed by a total of 5,281 persons.
                  One petition from the City of Saint John, headed by Bishop Sweeney, was signed by
                  736 persons, and another from Saint John County had 1,031 signatures. There were
                  counter-petitions also. For instance, there was one against provisions for
                  separate schools signed by 1, 163 persons from Saint John City and County.<note

                  persuasion, but an influential element of the Anglican Church opposed the
                  exclusion of religious instruction from the schools. However, the strongest
                  hostility came from the Roman Catholic section of the population.<note

               <p TEIform="p">It may be well to remind ourselves at this point that the question of
                  eliminating sectarianism from education had provoked violent controversy in many
                  countries. In general, the <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q"
                     >liberalism</q> of the nineteenth century fostered anti-clericalism, and
                  insisted that state-supported education should be non-sectarian and conducted by
                  lay teachers. In England, as we have seen, denominational influences were so
                  strong, particularly those of the Anglican Church, that even in the Education Act
                  of 1870 provisions were continued for the state subsidization of denominational
                  schools. In France, Napoleon III, besides exercising many tyrannies over the
                  curricula and faculties of schools and universities, had favored religious
                  schools. Religious instruction, therefore, prospered under the Second Empire.<note

                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">150</hi>
                  </note> But at the very time that the school question was agitating New Brunswick,
                  the Third Republic was being established amid the throes of a radical
                  working-class uprising, and the avowed anti-clericalism of the radical republicans
                  was a subject of deep concern to Roman Catholics. The Roman Catholic press of New
                  Brunswick, as we shall see, seized the opportunity to make a comparison between
                  the Paris <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">infidels</q> and the
                  supporters of nonreligious education in New Brunswick.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">Contemporary with all this, was the achievement of nationality in
                  Italy at the expense of the papal states, and the beginning in Prussia of the
                  conflict known as the Kulturkampf. Pope Pius IX, an opponent of the new political
                  liberalism, had issued his Syllabus of Errors in 1864, condemning civil control of
                  education. Soon, in acceptance of the challenge, Prussia under Bismarck was to
                  expel the Jesuits, make civil marriage compulsory, place ecclesiastical
                  seminaries under state control, and put an end to clerical school
                     inspection.<note target="n8.151" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               <p TEIform="p">In America, as we saw earlier, many circumstances favored the
                  development of non-sectarian education. But in Puritan Massachusetts Horace Mann
                  had had to meet the cry that the public schools were Godless schools,<note
                     target="n8.152" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">152</hi>
                  </note> and in New York City the Irish Roman Catholics made a determined, but
                  unsuccessful, fight between 1825 and 1842 for a division of public school
                     funds.<note target="n8.153" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">153</hi>
                  </note> In a number of the British North American provinces the outcome was
                  different. Quebec had separate schools, and in 1863, after twenty years of
                  agitation, the Roman Catholics of Upper Canada succeeded in their demands for such
                  schools. In the newly created province of Manitoba, the circumstances which had
                  attended the formation of the province out of the North West Territories had made
                  separate schools seem expedient, and the Manitoba School Act of 1871 contained
                  provisions for a dual system.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">When the proposal was made at the Quebec Conference on Confedera <pb
                     n="193" id="p193" TEIform="pb"/> tion that education should be a provincial
                  matter. D'Arcy McGee moved an addition to the proposal, namely, 'saving the rights
                  and privileges which the Protestant or Catholic minority in both Canadas may
                  possess as to the denominational schools at the time when the Constitutional Act
                  goes into operation', and his motion had carried.<note target="n8.154"

                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">154</hi>
                  </note> As a result of this, and the incorporation of a clause in the London
                  Resolutions, the ninety-third clause of the British North America Act safeguarded
                  the rights and privileges of any provincial minority. Later, the Roman Catholics
                  of New Brunswick were to demand remedial action from the Dominion Government on
                  the grounds that the Act of 1871 deprived them of rights and privileges which were
                  theirs under the Act of 1858. However, we find no reference to this clause, even
                  in <hi rend="italic" TEIform="hi">The Freeman</hi>, at the time the Act of 1871
                  was before the local legislature.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">While the Catholic viewpoint found considerable expression before and
                  after the Bill of 1871, D'Arcy McGee's speech in 1863 on the separate school
                  question of Upper Canada explained the Catholic attitude with such reasonableness
                  of language that it is worth noting. Meeting the claim of those who were hostile
                  to the petition of the Roman Catholics that there was no question of religious
                  liberty in the matter, he asked whether Catholics were to be guided by the
                  conscience of those who objected to their petition, or by their own conscience.
                  They asserted that they had conscientious objections to the common or mixed
                  system, and could not divorce religious from secular instruction in their schools.
                     <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">You say they ought not to
                     have such scruples . . . that they are either fancied or simulated.</q> But the
                  Quakers say that they have conscientious objections to invoking the name of God in
                  giving testimony in courts of Justice. We may think them wrong, and may feel that
                  the oath is essential to the solemnity of the evidence, but we give way to the
                  Quaker's scruples, and allow him to testify after his own fashion. The Israelites
                  may buy and sell on the day we call the Sabbath, and the dissenters also on days
                  established by law as fetes d'obligation in Lower Canada&#8212;<q rend="inline"

                  declaring it was a fathers' and brothers' bill. There were times and subjects in

                  but he was not afraid that in this country and age the ecclesiastical order would
                  become disproportionately powerful. He noted the existence of an assumption that
                  if separate schools were established, the children of Catholics would be
                  uneducated or ill-educated, but he said that he trusted human nature and parental
                  pride better than that. Were Catholics, he asked, less ambitious for their

                  </note> The Act was not to go into effect until January 1, 1872, so that people
                  might become familiar with its provisions, and so that the preliminary
                  organization might be effected.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">The principal features of this lengthy Act 77 of sixty-two sections
                  and many sub-sections were those to which reference has already been made. In
                  brief, the Act established free, tax-supported, non-sectarian schools and made
                  provision for the efficient operation, support, and supervision, of such
                  schools.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">The sections of the Act dealing with administration determined the
                  composition of the Board of Education, which was to remain as before, with the
                  addition of the President of the University of New Brunswick. The Board was
                  empowered to divide the province into local school districts containing no more
                  than fifty resident children between the ages of five and sixteen years of age,
                  unless the area embraced four square miles, or were a town, village, or populous
                  locality. The Board was to appoint fourteen inspectors at a total salary of $
                  4,000. This last was in the nature of a temporary provision, the duty of the
                  inspectors at this small salary being to familiarize their respective counties
                  with the workings of the Act. Subsequently, the Board reduced the number of the
                  inspectors, increased their salaries, and, by Regulation 42,<note target="n8.178"
                     anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">178</hi>
                  </note> established certain requirements in order to ensure the competency of the
                  inspectors for the actual work of inspection. The duties of the Superintendent and
                  of the inspectors, as laid down in the Act, were very similar to those outlined in
                  previous acts. The inspectors, however, had the additional duties of choosing
                  trustees, if a district failed to elect those officers. and of deciding what
                  districts should be entitled to special aid as <q rend="inline"
                     direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">poor</q> districts.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">The sections of the Act dealing with the mode of support provided that
                  teachers should receive their salaries from three sources, the Provincial
                  Treasury, the County Fund, and District Assessment. The teacher's allowance from
                  the province was to be based on license, but at the expiration of five years this
                  aid would depend partly on license and partly on the quality of the teaching.<note

                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">179</hi>
                  </note> The County Fund, a portion of the County rates amounting to thirty cents,
                     <pb n="198" id="p198" TEIform="pb"/> for every inhabitant of the County, was to
                  be distributed in the following manner: The Trustees of a school were to receive $
                  20 a year for every qualified teacher employed in the school; the balance of the
                  fund was to be apportioned to the Trustees according to the average number of
                  pupils in attendance at the school, as compared with the whole average number of
                  pupils attending the common schools of the County, and the length of time in which
                  the school was in operation. Finally, any sum required by a district in further
                  payment of teachers' salaries, or any sum required for other school purposes, was
                  to be raised by poll tax, and by assessment on real and personal property.
                  Districts reported by the Inspector as <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified"
                     TEIform="q">poor</q> districts were to receive special aid from the Provincial
                  Treasury and County Fund.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">The duties of trustees and teachers were outlined in detail, and
                  precise regulations framed relating to the election of trustees in each school
                  district, their qualifications, and the holding of an annual meeting by the
                  ratepayers. All schools under the Act were to be free and non-sectarian, trustees
                  were to make arrangements for the purchase, rental or erection of school
                  buildings, and to borrow money if necessary.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">Superior Schools were provided for, under conditions very similar to
                  those stipulated in the Act of 1858, and the Trustees of Grammar Schools might
                  unite with the Trustees of any district for the management and support of the
                  Grammar School. The City of Saint John was to constitute one school district,
                  likewise the City of Fredericton. In each case the Board of Trustees was to
                  consist of seven members, three of whom were to be appointed by the Governor in
                  Council, and the remainder by the City Council. Section 59 ruled that similar
                  provisions might be extended under certain conditions to any incorporated town in
                  the province.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">Section 29 of the Act called for the grading of schools into
                  elementary, advanced, and High School departments, whenever the population was
                  sufficient for the purpose, and subsequent regulations pointed out the advantages
                  of such classification.<note target="n8.180" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">180</hi>
                  </note> Among these regulations No. 37 lengthened the period of training at the
                  Normal School to five months,<note target="n8.181" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">181</hi>
                  </note> and No. 20 prohibited the exhibition of emblems and symbols distinctive of
                  any national or other society, political party or religious organization, either
                  in the school-room or on the person of any teacher or pupil.<note target="n8.182"

                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">182</hi>
                  </note> Regulation 21 gave teachers the privilege of opening and closing the daily
                  exercises of the school by the reading of a portion of Scripture, out of the
                  Common or Douay version, and by the offering of the Lord's Prayer, but no teacher
                  could compel any pupil to be present at these exercises against the wish of his
                  parent or guardian.<note target="n8.183" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </p>

               <p TEIform="p">The provision which this Act made for the localizing of authority and
                  control was its most revolutionary feature, aside from the provisions for free,
                  tax-supported, non-sectarian schools. The parish had proved to be an unsuit- <pb
                     n="199" id="p199" TEIform="pb"/> able unit. The Trustees, as parish officers,
                  had been too remote or too indifferent to make efficient authorities. The new Act
                  abandoned the idea of parish officers, and made the inhabitants of a small area
                  responsible for the wise expenditure of local funds, and for the efficient
                  operation of local schools. In the Remarks appended to the Regulations which were
                  issued on November 15, 1871, emphasis was placed on this feature, and on the fact
                  that the share which a district would receive of County moneys would depend on the
                  efficient operation of the school.<note target="n8.184" anchored="yes"
                     TEIform="note">
                     <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">184</hi>
                  </note> Clearly, it was hoped that under the new arrangements local interest, and
                  even local pride, might be aroused. The fact that in recent times the trend has
                  been toward a larger unit and the amalgamation of districts is no proof that the
                  establishment of small districts in 1871 was unnecessary or unwise. Changing times
                  have brought improved standards and new demands for better facilities, and have
                  also made possible consolidations and extensions which were out of the question
                  seventy years ago. In those ideas and practices which may seem obsolete to one age
                  there was once validity and utility in terms of the environment which nurtured
                  them.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">With the passage of this Act the province had moved forward into the
                  company of those states which acknowledged, in theory at any rate, that an
                  education was the birthright of every child. The Act, of course, could work no
                  sudden miraculous changes, for there could be no quick solution of the old problem
                  of popular indifference. Several years were to elapse before every community in
                  the province organized schools. Not only was there indifference, but even active
                  opposition, particularly from the Roman Catholic element of the population. This
                  opposition led to a constitutional struggle in the courts, and in one locality to
                  rioting, with loss of life and property.</p>

               <p TEIform="p">While under the Act a teacher's position was more secure than
                  formerly, the old problem of an insufficiency of trained and enterprising teachers
                  persisted, and, if anything, grew more acute as the westward expansion of Canada
                  drew hundreds of young men from the province. New problems were also to arise, and
                  new dangers, for the sense of achievement which the Act of 1871 engendered could
                  lead to complacency and self-satisfaction, blinding people to the fact that
                  progress must be indefinite.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">Since Confederation scarcely any controversy has been so bitter and
               sustained as that which revolved around certain features of the Common Schools Act.
               During the early seventies and again in the eighteen-nineties, the Act, or the
               operation of the Act, became the storm centre of a controversy involving so many
               issues and interests that in itself it becomes a major topic.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">When Superintendent Rand wrote his first report to the legislature, he
               said that since New Brunswick was almost the last country on the continent to enact a
               Free School Law, the success of the Free School system did not depend on its success
               or failure in New Brunswick. In fact it was not the Act but the people of the
               province who were on trial. Less in words than by means of figures and comparisons he
               implied that under the Act the people were beginning to accept the responsibility of
               educating the children of the country. The enrolment during the summer term of 1872
               showed an increase of 5,856 over that of the corresponding term of the preceding
               year, a greater advance than that made during the whole of the previous ten years.
               Moreover, comparing the school attendance in New Brunswick in 1872 with that reached
               in Nova Scotia during the first year of the Free School system in that province, the
               educational progress of New Brunswick had surpassed that of the sister province.
               This, Rand thought, must be regarded as very satisfactory.<note target="n9.1"
                  anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">1</hi>
               </note>
            </p>

            <p TEIform="p">The advance had been made, however, in only ten of the counties. In Kent,
               Northumberland, and Victoria the aggregate school attendance had remained stationary,
               and in Gloucester County there had been a drop of 1,117.<note target="n9.2"

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">2</hi>
               </note> The report of the Inspector for the latter county admitted that opposition to
               the Act had prevented the establishment of schools,<note target="n9.3" anchored="yes"
                  TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">3</hi>
               </note> a state of affairs which continued in that area for several years. The
               inspectors for the other recalcitrant counties told of the same difficulty. In fact,
               when Inspector Balloch took office in May of 1875 for the new county of Madawaska,
               which, until 1873 had been part of Victoria County, be found no schools in operation
               there under the Act<note target="n9.4" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">4</hi>
               </note>. As late as 1876 Inspector Wood of Kent County reported the embarrassment to
               school trustees who had incurred liabilities for school purposes in reliance on a
               share of the county fund, when their drafts on that fund remained unpaid, because in
               several parishes ordinary means had proved insufficient to secure the collection of
               the county rates. The unpaid claims upon the Kent County school fund amounted to $
               13,000, and many schools inconsequence had to close. People, so it seemed, had come
               to believe that the Government <pb n="201" id="p201" TEIform="pb"/> either could not
               or dared not enforce the requirements of the Act.<note target="n9.5" anchored="yes"
                  TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">5</hi>
               </note>
            </p>

            <p TEIform="p">While one realizes from these and similar official reports that the new
               Act was by no means universally accepted, only from the newspapers and parliamentary
               debates of the time can one gain an adequate idea of the sustained bitterness of the
               controversy evoked by the non-sectarian clauses of the measure. Local aspects of the
               imbroglia, such as failure to establish schools and refusal to pay taxes, hindered
               the development of education, created ferment in many communities, and set the
               newspapers by the ears. Such incidents as rioting at Caraquet in Gloucester County,
               the sale at auction of Bishop Sweeney's carriage and span of horses because of his
               refusal to pay taxes, the confiscation of Father McDevitt's cow, and the arrest of
               Father Michaud, who had accepted the seizure of his goods with less grace than had
               Father McDevitt, furnished copy for the most vocal of both parties. When, however,
               the Roman Catholic minority appealed to one court after another the controversy
               gained wide publicity, and when they annually carried their grievance to the Canadian
               House of Commons the question became a constitutional one, of significance for both
               Dominion and Provincial politics, since in it were involved such matters as
               provincial autonomy and dominion coercive powers, delicate questions in an infant
               federation.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">At the parliamentary session of 1872 Auguste Renaud, member for Kent
               County, called for the correspondence relative to the School Act of New Brunswick,
               and complained of the tyranny and injustice of the law.<note target="n9.6"

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">6</hi>
               </note> Anglin of Saint John explained that under the old law, in Catholic Districts
               Catholic teachers were appointed and the Catholic catechism was taught, not only
               orally, but by means of Catholic textbooks.<note target="n9.7" anchored="yes"

               had most respectfully petitioned the Dominion Government, and after months of waiting
               had been informed that the Act would not be disallowed, whereupon the local
               legislature had made it still more <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q"
                  >intolerable and hateful</q> to the Catholics by the regulations they had framed
               under it.<note target="n9.8" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">8</hi>
               </note> He declared that since the Act deprived Catholics of rights which they had
               previously enjoyed, it was unconstitutional. Under Confederation, which professed to
               protect the rights of all classes, such a law ought not to be allowed to remain in
               force, and the Dominion Government should have treated the question not merely as a
               legal one but as one of policy and justice.<note target="n9.9" anchored="yes"

               </note>
            </p>

            <p TEIform="p">With this preliminary the subject of the New Brunswick School Law began
               its course as a topic of debate in Dominion politics. Early in the session, Sir John
               A. MacDonald expressed the opinion that the nature of the law was not a matter in
               which the House of Commons could take action. He said that although he had always
               been a consistent friend of separate schools, he must re- <pb n="202" id="p202"
                  TEIform="pb"/> mind the House that under Confederation the question of education
               had been expressly left to the different provinces. In his view, according to the
               British North America Act there were only two cases in which the Government of the
               Dominion was justified in advising the disallowance of a local act&#8212;first, if the
               act was unconstitutional; second, if it was injurious to the interests of the whole
               Dominion. His colleagues, who included men whose opinions as lawyers must be
               respected, and men who as Roman Catholics sincerely desired to protect their
               religious privileges, were unanimous, he said, in believing that the New Brunswick
               Act could not be impugned on the ground of unconstitutionality. On the second ground,
               Sir John disposed of the argument that the Act prejudicially affected the whole
               Dominion by pointing out that it was a law setting up a Common School system for New
               Brunswick alone. Whether it was good, bad, fair or unfair, was a matter for the
               consideration of the representatives of the people of New Brunswick. In his opinion,
               it was indiscreet to agitate against the law on the ground that it repudiated an Act
               which authorized a Separate School system. The Catholics of New Brunswick might think
               that the old Act was less objectionable than the new one, but no separate school
               system had been provided by the Act of 1858. The true course for the New Brunswick
               Catholics was, he advised, to follow the example of the Catholics of Ontario, and
               fight the matter out in the local legislature. He thought that if a large body like
               the Catholic people of New Brunswick desired a separate school system, they should
               have it, but it could only be obtained by working for it. They might not succeed
               during the current session of the New Brunswick legislature but they could afford to
               wait as the Catholics of Ontario had waited. The Government of the Dominion could not
               act in the matter. <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">The constitution
                  which bad hitherto worked so easily and so well, could not survive the wrench that
                  would be given if the Dominion Government assumed to dictate the policy or
                  question the decision of the Legislatures of the different provinces on subjects

            <p TEIform="p">Sir George E. Cartier, while anxious to uphold the interests of his
               co-religionists, concurred in the Prime Minister's remarks. He said that the old
               School Act of New Brunswick granted no separate schools to the Catholics and no
               special rights, but he believed that if they went to work properly, not fanatically,
               but justly, they would obtain the same right of separate schools that had been
               granted in Ontario.<note target="n9.11" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

            </p>

            <p TEIform="p">Thomas Costigan of Victoria County dissented, however, from this view of
               the government leaders, contending that in New Brunswick under the old law Catholic
               and French schools had existed, kept up at the expense of the country. He declared
               that when at Westminster the Quebec resolutions had been altered to provide that if
               special schools existed by law at the time of union, their rights should not be
               affected, it almost seemed that those words had been put in for the purpose of
               working against the Catholics of New Brunswick. He questioned the constitutionality
               of the Act of 1871 on the second <pb n="203" id="p203" TEIform="pb"/> grounds also.
                  <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">It had already interfered with
                  immigration and had been the cause of driving from his part of the country

            </p>

            <p TEIform="p">Later in the session Costigan pressed his views, by moving a resolution
               calling on the House to present an address to the Governor General praying him to
               disallow the New Brunswick law.<note target="n9.13" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">13</hi>
               </note> Cartier again attempted the thankless task of convincing his fellow Catholics
               of the potentialities for trouble bound up in Costigan's resolution. He pointed out
               that the address tended to place the rights of the Catholics of the Dominion in the
               hands of a Protestant majority. The Protestants of Lower Canada were satisfied at the
               time, but if this motion should pass to satisfy the Catholics of New Brunswick, then
               the Protestant minority of Quebec might some day demand a change in the school law of
               Quebec. He trusted that the mover of the resolution would see the false position in
               which he had placed the matter, and he declared that to ask the House to advise the
               Governor to disallow the act was to upset the basis of responsible government. He
               concluded by terming Costigan's motion <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified"
                  TEIform="q">imprudent</q> and <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q"

            <p TEIform="p">In this lengthy debate, religious sympathy seems to have been the guide
               to the conduct of many of the members, but political and constitutional
               considerations came first with others, especially with members of the government. We
               note that Catholics as well as Protestants opposed Costigan's resolution, and that a
               few Protestants joined with Catholics in urging relief for the latter. The viewpoints
               of the following speakers present a fair cross section of the whole debate.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">The Honorable Hector Langevin, who later came to be regarded as the
               political leader of the French-Canadian clericals, like his colleague and fellow
               Catholic, Cartier, opposed the resolution as a threat to the Constitution.<note

               </note> So did the Honorable A. J. Smith, at one time the leader of the
               anti-Confederation party in New Brunswick. Smith said he had been opposed to the <q
                  rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">unholy influences</q> which had
               brought Confederation about, but that after it was carried he had considered it his
               duty to give the union loyal support. He appealed especially to the members from
               Quebec not to do anything which would seem a violation of the constitution. From that
               province, with her especial institutions, he had expected support for the local
               government of New Brunswick.<note target="n9.16" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">16</hi>
               </note> The Honorable J. H. Gray defended the non-sectarian principle of the New
               Brunswick School Act, declaring <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">it
                  did seem lessening the dignity and character of religion to teach it in the same
                  way as a rule of arithmetic or grammar</q>. He also said that if Parliament
               interfered in this matter, the advocates of Confederation would be charged by their
               constituents with allowing the rights of New Brunswick to be trifled with. Such
               interference, he warned, would remove any guarantee to new provinces that if they
               entered the Dominion their rights <pb n="204" id="p204" TEIform="pb"/> would be
                  preserved.<note target="n9.17" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">17</hi>
               </note> Dorion differed from his colleagues on the question, maintaining that New
               Brunswick had had separate schools before Confederation <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">in point of view</q>, whatever that may mean. His
               warning was that if the New Brunswick law were allowed to remain, it might lead to
               such union among the Catholics of New Brunswick, Quebec and Ontario, and such
               hostility of class against class, as would stop the action of the Dominion
                  Government.<note target="n9.18" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

            <p TEIform="p">The Honorable Edward Blake, although he agreed with Dorion that the
               schools of New Brunswick previous to 1871 were practically denominational schools,
               and asserted that the change from the elasticity of the old law to the rigidity of
               the new was not necessary to satisfy the scruples of Protestants, feared that the
               rights of the provinces would not be worth the paper on which the constitution was
               written if it could be said that all rights could be changed on addresses alone.<note

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">19</hi>
               </note> Still another minister, Chauveau, admitted the validity of the objections to
               interference with provincial legislation, but said that to him the matter was a
               question of two evils, either of allowing the minority in New Brunswick to suffer
               under a grievous wrong or of applying such a remedy as was within the power of the
               House to afford.<note target="n9.20" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </note> Colby, like Chauveau and Dorion, a member from Quebec, believed that
               education must be subordinated to religion, but did not believe in the employment of
               the veto power unless there were a palpable violation of the constitution. Under the
               existing circumstances he thought that the House should refrain from the exercise of
               that power.<note target="n9.21" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </note> Alonzo Wright said that as a Protestant representative of a Catholic county
               in Lower Canada he felt bound to express his opinion, which was that the motion was
               simply to secure for the Catholics of New Brunswick the same rights which were
               accorded to the Protestant minority in the Province of Quebec.<note target="n9.22"

            <p TEIform="p">Thus the debate seesawed back and forth, enlivened by a number of
               suggestions and amendments. The first of these, moved by Gray, stressed the
               importance of provincial rights, declared that the New Brunswick legislation in
               question could be repealed or altered only by the local legislature, and concluded
               that the House of Commons did not deem it proper to interfere with whatever advice
               the responsible ministers of the Crown might tender to His Excellency respecting the
                  law.<note target="n9.23" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </note> An amendment was then moved by Chauveau that an address be presented to the
               Queen, praying her to cause an act to be passed amending the British North America
               Act, so that every religious denomination in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia should
               continue to possess all the rights and privileges with regard to their schools that
               they had enjoyed at the time of the passing of the British North America Act, and to
               the same extent as if such rights and privileges had been duly established by
                  law.<note target="n9.24" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </note> An amendment moved <pb n="205" id="p205" TEIform="pb"/> by Colby, who did not
               want the constitution tampered with, merely recorded an expression of regret on the
               part of the House that the School Law of New Brunswick had proved unsatisfactory to a
               large portion of the population of that province<note target="n9.25" anchored="yes"

               </note> Blake suggested that the proper course was to ask the local Government to
               take action, or to obtain the opinion of the law officers of the Crown in England as
               to the right of the New Brunswick legislature to make the changes in the school law
               which had been made.<note target="n9.27" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </note> When Colby's amendment had passed, Dorion wanted added to it an expression of
               regret that the Governor General had not been advised to disallow the School Act of
               1871. MacDonald and Cartier having intimated that this was equivalent to a vote of
               non-confidence, Dorion's amendment was defeated by 117 votes to 38.<note

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">28</hi>
               </note> The end of the matter was, that to Colby's motion expressing regret at the
               dissatisfaction which had been caused by the New Brunswick law, the Honorable
               Alexander MacKenzie moved an addition along the lines of Blake's suggestion. This
               was, in effect, that the opinion of the law officers of the Crown, and if possible of
               the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, should be obtained as to the right of
               the New Brunswick legislature to change the school law as it had done, with a view to
               ascertaining whether or not the Dominion Parliament had the power in this case to
               pass remedial legislation under the fourth subsection of clause 93 of the British
               North America Act.<note target="n9.29" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

            <p TEIform="p">In New Brunswick, the upholders of the school law had followed these
               proceedings in the House of Commons with interest and indignation. When Chauveau's
               amendment was introduced the Executive Council of New Brunswick went on record in a
               memorandum dated May 29, 1872, in which they warned the Government and Parliament of
               Canada of the danger involved in the passage of such a resolution, and asserted the
               right of the legislature of New Brunswick to legislate without interference upon all
               questions affecting the education of the province.<note target="n9.30" anchored="yes"

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">30</hi>
               </note> In the course of the year the Catholics of New Brunswick carried their case
               to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, urging that the Act of 1871 affected them
               prejudicially, contrary to sub-section one of section 93 of the British North America
               Act. While the case was still before the court the Executive Council in Committee, on
               December 23, 1872, recorded a refusal to admit the assumption of the resolution
               passed at the previous session of the House of Commons that the School Act of 1871
               had made such changes in the law as deprived Roman Catholics of privileges enjoyed at
               the time of union in respect to religious education. The Council concurred in the
               opinion of Canada's Minister of Justice that the Acts repealed in 1871 made no
               reference to separate, dissentient, or denominational schools, and that examination
                  <pb n="206" id="p206" TEIform="pb"/> had failed to reveal the existence of any
               provincial statute establishing such special schools. With respect to claims that the
               Act of 1858 had legalized denominational tuition, the Council stated: <q
                  rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">An irregular and defective
                  administration of the law might tolerate illegal practices, and allow parties to
                  derive unwarrantable advantages in violation of the law; but privileges enjoyed in
                  violation of the law cannot give rights under the law</q>. The Council also
               protested against the submission to the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown of
               the right of the New Brunswick legislature to deal exclusively with the subject of
               education. They pointed out that the question whether the Act of 1871 was ultra vires
               within the intent and meaning of the 93rd section of the British North America Act
               was pending in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick. In the opinion of the Council the
               only legal and constitutional appeal from that judgment was by the dissentient
               parties to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.<note target="n9.31"

            <p TEIform="p">We are told that during the federal election campaign of 1872 the subject
               of the New Brunswick law was much discussed in the province of Quebec.<note

               </note> At the next session of the Dominion House, the Catholic members from that
               province were almost unanimous in supporting Costigan's second attempt to secure
               federal intervention. By that time the Supreme Court of New Brunswick had delivered a
               judgment upholding the validity of the New Brunswick law, and the Law Officers of the
               Crown in England, to whom the Governor General had submitted the question, had also
               ruled that the Act was within the jurisdiction of the New Brunswick Legislature.
               Since the passage of the original Act, the New Brunswick Legislature, in order to
               prevent the contravention of the purpose of the School Law by the inhabitants of
               school districts, had passed a series of acts legalizing assessments for school
               purposes under the Act.<note target="n9.33" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               at the subsequent legislation to implement that Act. It urged that the question of
               the, va4idity of the original Act be submitted to the Judicial Committee of the Privy
               Council, and that in the meantime it was the duty of the Governor General to disallow
               the more recent legislation.<note target="n9.34" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

            <p TEIform="p">Again Sir John A. MacDonald expressed sympathy with the Catholics, but
               again indicated that the question was not one of sympathy but of constitutional
               principle. He said that originally he had favored a legislative union but other ideas
               had prevailed. If a resolution like this were to pass, he would say that his original
               ideas had been carried out, <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">that a
                  federal union of the Provinces was at an end; that the legislative union had
                  commenced</q>. He pointed out that the effect of the well-meant resolution passed
               by Parliament at its last session had been regarded by the New Brunswick Legislature
               as an attempt to coerce them. What, he asked, would be the feeling if Parliament <pb
                  n="207" id="p207" TEIform="pb"/> went further and asked the Governor General to
               disallow measures which were within the competence of the local legislature. Because
               of the recent judgments of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, and of the Law
               Officers in England, one must suppose that the law was valid. He warned the House
               that if they adopted this resolution, they must be prepared to discuss the justice of
               every law passed by every provincial legislature, and that Parliament would become
               simply a court of appeal to try whether the provincial legislatures were right or
               wrong in their conclusions.<note target="n9.35" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               resolution which said that it was the Governor General's duty to disallow the recent
               acts of the New Brunswick Legislature. He said that the duty of advising the Governor

               that the resolution had been laid before the Governor General. His Excellency,
               assured by the Law Officers that the Act of 1871 was a matter for the Legislature of
               New Brunswick, and assured also by the Minister of Justice that the subsidiary acts
               were equally valid, could not, at the time, comply with the terms of the resolution,
               but would apply to Her Majesty's Government for instructions on the subject. Sir John
               intimated, however, that the Government would be willing to ask Parliament for a vote
               of money to defray the expenses of those who wished to have the matter litigated
               before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.<note target="n9.38"

            <p TEIform="p">His Excellency, the Earl of Dufferin, in explaining to Kimberley, the
               Secretary of State, those circumstances which had led to the resolution and to his
               own action in submitting the matter to Her Majesty's Government, said he had followed
               the course recommended to him by his responsible advisers. He also sub-joined a copy
               of a remonstrance which had been addressed to him by a delegation from the Government
               of New Brunswick against the interference by the Dominion Parliament with the
               constitutional action of the Provincial Legislature. Kimberley replied that the Law
               Officers of the Crown advised that the subsidiary acts on education were, like the
               Act of 1871, within the powers of the New Brunswick Legislature, and that the
               Canadian House of Commons could not constitutionally interfere with their operation
               by passing such a resolution as that of May 14. Kimberley also informed Dufferin that
               it would be in accordance with the Imperial Act and with the general spirit of <pb

               guided by the advice of his responsible ministers of the Dominion. During the
               Parliamentary session of 1875 this statement was referred to more than once. Palmer
               interpreted it as an indication of how sacredly the British Government regarded

               responsible government, maintained that it was destructive of the spirit of those
               principles. MacKenzie, the Prime Minister, expressed the belief that the principle
               that the Governor General must act on the advice of his ministers was self-evident.
               He said he could only account for this observation in the despatch to the Governor
               General by supposing it to be some hasty expression of opinion made without
               considering the effect. On MacKenzie's suggestion that the matter had better not be

            <p TEIform="p">Before Costigan's persistence forced the subject again on a reluctant
               Parliament, an effort was made in New Brunswick by the Bishop of Saint John to come
               to an agreement with the Government; Regulation 20 of the Regulations of the Board of
               Education was amended; and the New Brunswick Legislature, with a provincial election
               coming up, devoted several stormy periods to a discussion of the whole question.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">This attempt in New Brunswick to arrive at a settlement was not the
               first, for shortly after the Act had come into effect the Church authorities and the
               Saint John School Board had negotiated with each other on the subject. The School
               Board, faced by the scarcity of suitable school buildings in the city,<note
                  target="n9.43" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">43</hi>
               </note> were anxious, on their own statement, to secure the co-operation of the Roman
               Catholic authorities in Saint John. Correspondence relating to the conditions under
               which the Schools of the Christian Brothers and of the Sisters of Charity might be
               placed under the Saint John School Board extended over a period of several months,
               but efforts to bring about an arrangement satisfactory to both sides failed. The
               refusal of the Board of Education to deviate from the non-sectarian principles of the
               Act, and the insistence on the other hand of Bishop Sweeney and other Roman Catholic
               clergymen on a special interpretation of Regulation 20, proved a barrier to the
               unification of the school system of the City of Saint John.<note target="n9.44"

            <p TEIform="p">The second effort to arrange a settlement was made in 1873, when Bishop
               Sweeney submitted three propositions to a committee of the New Brunswick Government,
               consisting of the Premier and two other members. His <pb n="209" id="p209"
                  TEIform="pb"/> Lordship proposed that the Christian Brothers and the Sisters of
               Charity be licensed to teach in the public schools of the province on successfully
               passing examinations conducted in a special manner; that the schools taught by such
               religious orders should be open to all the Roman Catholic children resident in any
               part of the district; and that books prescribed by the Board of Education, if deemed
               objectionable by the Bishop, might be replaced by the books of the Christian
               Brothers. To the first of these propositions, the Executive Council replied that it
               would not be objectionable to license as teachers the Christian Brothers and Sisters
               of Charity, permitting them to wear their own distinctive garb, but that to grant the
               request of a special examination would be dealing exceptionally in favor of a single
               denomination, and contrary therefore to the spirit and intent of the Act. In answer
               to the second proposal, the Council stated that the attendance of children at any
               particular school in their district was a matter that might properly be left to the
               discretion of the trustees. The third proposition received an unequivocal negative.
               In any school conducted under the Act no books not sanctioned by the Board of
               Education might be used.<note target="n9.45" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

            <p TEIform="p">The concession indicated in the answer to Bishop Sweeney's first
               proposition with regard to the garb of the teaching orders became definite when, on
               December 18, 1873, the Board of Education ordered that Regulation 20, which
               prohibited the exhibition in the classroom of certain symbols, be amended by the
               addition of the following words: <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q"
                  >but nothing herein shall be taken to refer to any peculiarity of the teacher's
                  garb, or to the wearing of the cross or other emblems worn by the members of any
                  denomination of Christians</q>. In order that everyone might know of the
               amendment, it was ordered that the amended regulation be inserted in the Royal
                  Gazette.<note target="n9.46" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

            <p TEIform="p">No further progress toward a reconciliation had been made when the
               Legislature met in 1874. As it was encumbent on the Government to take cognizance of
               the many petitions which had been presented praying for such amendments of the School
               Law as might secure separate schools to the Roman Catholics of the province, William
               Wedderburn moved a resolution on the subject. This resolution reaffirmed the doctrine
               that any state system of education should grant to all the people of the province
               similar and equal rights in respect to education, without distinction of class or
               creed, and objected to any curtailment of the powers granted to the Legislature by
               the British North America Act. While expressing regret that the House could not
               comply with the prayer of the petitioners, the resolution declared that no acts
               should be done or passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, or by the
               Parliament of Canada, to impair or alter the rights and jurisdiction vested in the
               Legislature by the terms of the British North America Act, unless the Legislature had
               first signified its consent.<note target="n9.47" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               <pb n="210" id="p210" TEIform="pb"/> Wedderburn had no sooner given warning that the
               rising cry for the repeal of the Act of 1871 was but an effort to divert the current
               of public opinion from the real question of separate schools,<note target="n9.48"

               </note> than James Nowlan moved a resolution calling for the repeal of the Act of
               1871 and the revival of the Act of 1858, with necessary provisions protecting
               existing contracts and assessments.<note target="n9.49" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

            <p TEIform="p">The debate which ensued was marked by less restraint and dignity than the
               previous debates at Ottawa, and by a greater display of personal and sectarian
               feeling. Indicative perhaps of a weariness which the long drawn-out controversy was
               beginning to induce was the suggestion of a Protestant member that Catholic children
               should be allowed religious instruction during the sixth hour of the school session.
               He would grant this concession, he said, not as a right, <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">but in the interests of peace</q>.<note

               </note> Some idea of the difficulties which had impeded the operation of the Act may
               be gained from an observation by the Attorney General that because of the appeals to
               Ottawa and to England people were almost led to believe that the whole law was
               unconstitutional. He said that as a result, trustees, constables, and justices had
               been afraid to do their duty under the Act lest it should transpire that they had
               acted illegally. Inequality in assessments, due to no fault of the school law, but to
               the want of proper system in the general assessment law, had created dissatisfaction,
               and the impossibility of laying off school districts to suit the convenience of all
               the residents had been a further difficulty.<note target="n9.51" anchored="yes"

            <p TEIform="p">In connection with this latter matter one member remarked that in his

               country as they did of the latitude of Heaven or of the geography of the moon.<note

            </p>

            <p TEIform="p">The address of Premier King was the longest and most vigorous speech of
               the debate. King, on whom as Attorney General the responsibility had fallen of
               defending the Act during this period of attack and litigation, made no effort to deal
               delicately with the sectarian question, but expressed himself with extreme frankness,
               even bluntness. Those who blamed the Government for precipitating this question on
               New Brunswick seemed unaware, he said, of what was going on in Europe and in the
               United States. This question of religion in education was an issue in Prussia,
               Austria, Switzerland, England, and in the United States. In fact, the Catholic Church
               was making a stand everywhere for new privileges and powers and was being everywhere
               resisted. The New Brunswick School Law had been characterized as oppressive to Roman
               Catholics. When, asked King, was it discovered that non-sectarian schools were not
               the same <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">galling tyranny</q> in
               every state in the American Union, in Nova Scotia, and in Prince Edward Island. <q
                  rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">New Brunswick is only following the
                  general law of the continent; and because it does not follow the peddling,
                  compromising <pb n="211" id="p211" TEIform="pb"/> policy of Ontario and Quebec, it
                  is said that the Government is tyrannizing over the consciences of Catholics.</q>
               He claimed that the Irish immigrant settled down amongst the people of the United
               States and shared with them the advantages of the free non-sectarian schools of that
               country. It was true that in the large cities of the United States the Catholics were
               endeavoring to get parochial schools, but no such attempt was being made general. In
               the new English Education Act the provisions of the future were non-denominational;
               in Scotland the rights of denominations in the board schools had been swept away. <q
                  rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">The genius of the politics of
                  Christian nations is not in favor of separate schools.</q>
            </p>


            <p TEIform="p">Dealing with those provisions of the British North America Act which
               related to education, King said that when the Quebec scheme was before the people it
               contained nothing but a general clause vesting the powers of legislating in regard to
               education in the several provinces, but that when the delegates met at Westminster
               they found, sitting side by side with them, arch-bishops and clergy of the Catholic
               Church. When the Confederation Act was passed the people of the province discovered
               that something had been put in, added surreptitiously as far as the people were
               concerned, something which was meant by those who placed it there to perpetuate the
               liberties which the Catholics had been permitted to take with the New Brunswick
               Parish School Act. He described the theory of the School Law of 1871 as one of
               equality, symbolizing the genius of the country in terms of which all men were equal
               before the law. He warned his hearers that the policy of the Catholic Church had
               undergone a great change during the preceding twenty years, under the development of
               the Ultramontane doctrine. That doctrine, he said, taught the faithful that the State
               was but a usurping power with which the Church had, for the time being, to make the
               best terms it could. How was it, he asked, that the Catholic conscience was so much
               more tender in New Brunswick than in Ontario, where, of the 70,000 Catholic children
               in the public schools, only 20,000 attended the separate schools, while the other
               50,000 attended the non-sectarian schools. Calling on the Assembly not to yield for
               the sake of peace, he said that under the cloak of repeal church endowment was
               sought. <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">The little band of
                  Repealers are but the drift wood and seaweed on the crest of the wave of separate
                  schools, which is urging and driving them forward.</q> His final warnings were
               urgent. <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">Beware of compromise;
                  accept none. There is no half-way house between religious equality and separate
                  schools. If our privileges are given away today they are given for all time.</q>

               electoral campaign in which the School Act was the main issue. Out of 41 members
               elected, only 5 candidates, representing Gloucester, Kent, and Madawaska Counties,
               were returned in favor of separate schools.<note target="n9.57" anchored="yes"

            <p TEIform="p">With that question definitely settled and with a local legislature
               strongly opposed to Separate Schools, the Roman Catholics of New Brunswick pinned
               their hopes on an amendment to the British North America Act to cover their case. If
               that hope should fail, and if the Government of New Brunswick should refuse to
               compromise, they were faced with the necessity of paying taxes for schools to which
               they could not send their children unless they disobeyed their clergy. A riot at
               Caraquet in January of 1875 did nothing to improve the feeling on either side,
               although by calling attention to the importance of a settlement, it may have helped
               to bring about the eventual compromise. There is no evidence, however, that violence
               was deliberately planned with that purpose in mind, for the disturbance seems to have
               been the simple and spontaneous reaction of an impulsive and probably illiterate
                  people,<note target="n9.59" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </note> susceptible to mass emotion and capable of strong family, community, and
               national loyalties.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">The disturbance grew out of feeling over a local school meeting. From
               remarks made in the Assembly in 1875, when Blanchard of Caraquet introduced a bill to
               legalize the proceedings at a parish school meeting held in November, 1874, we learn
               that the meeting had been declared illegal and that subsequently a minority,
               presumably English and Protestant, had held a second meeting on January 4, 1875, and
               had sent returns to the Sessions which had been confirmed by that body. Blanchard
               warned that if his bill did not pass, there would be more serious trouble than had
               occurred already, for the people of Caraquet declared that they would not obey the
               trustees appointed at the second meeting. The Provincial Secretary thereupon
               explained that Blanchard, who had been the chairman of the first meeting, had not
               paid his county assessment for schools and was therefore not legally qualified to
               occupy the chair, and that the persons elected as officers, and those who voted for
               them, were disqualified for the same reason. He deprecated Blanchard's threatening
               language, and asked if that gentleman came before the House as an advocate of such
               scenes as Caraquet had already witnessed. No member, said the Provincial Secretary,
                  <pb n="213" id="p213" TEIform="pb"/> should say in the House that the people were
               bound not to obey officers duly appointed. The Government would not permit the laws
               of the Legislature to be trampled upon, and people who set themselves above the law
               would be taught their duty, even if anarchy reared its head for a time. Were
               citizens, he asked, who had paid their rates to be <q rend="inline"

               wife and children, demanded money, and threatened with vengeance all those who had
               paid their school taxes.<note target="n9.61" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               were called on to surrender by Deputy Cable and his men, they discharged shot guns
               and pistols from a loft, and when the Sheriff's party made a rush one of his men,
               John Gifford, was killed. In the mel&#233;e Louis Meyou, one of the rioters, was wounded.

               battery of artillery and a company of volunteers, the rioters were arrested and order
               was restored.<note target="n9.62" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               Maillieau, (this name appears under a variety of forms), and the court record of the

               incomplete, and in places nearly indecipherable. Supplemented, however, by the
               arguments which were presented before the Supreme Court of New Brunswick when Judge
               Allen reserved the case, they furnish something more than the outlines of the
               story.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">It seems clear that the rioters, frightened and excited when they heard
               that the sheriff was coming with warrants against them, had hidden in the loft of
               Andrew Albert's house and had had guns with them, but whether they had taken these to
               bolster up their courage, to make a brave show in the hope of frightening the posse
               away, or with deliberate intent to shoot, is not certain,<note target="n9.66"
                  anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">66</hi>
               </note> although Albert did testify that they had said if they were attacked they
               would defend themselves. In the second place, we note that the rioters and their
               friends seemed generally unwilling or unable to give very explicit information about
               the course of events. One man had hidden in a sail and so had seen nothing; another
               had been asleep in the loft until after the firing began; the attention of Andrew
               Albert, in whose house the shooting occurred, had been distracted by his wife. She
               had fainted, he explained, when one of the Sheriff's men, on entering the house, had
               pointed a gun at her; consequently he was too busy looking after her to notice what
               was going on. There was also uncertainty among the rioters as to the identity of the
               persons who had brought and fired the guns. There was a tendency, however, to
               attribute the shooting of Gifford to the deceased Maillieau. A number of witnesses
               testified that Maillieau had had a gun, and one of the rioters said he saw him shoot
               straight at the door of the loft, whereupon a man fell from the trap.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">On several points the evidence was conflicting. Clotel Chesson swore that
               the water on the stove was cold. Stanislaus Albert, however, said that he saw pots of
               water boiling on the stove. Richard Sewell, one of the first of the Sheriff's men to
               enter the house, swore that he took a can of hot water from one of the women who met
               them and spilled it out, and a constable in the Sheriff's party swore that two women
               had <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">made at them</q> with scalding
               water. Which party had taken the lead in the shooting was another question which
               produced contradictory evidence. Andrew Albert claimed that the search party had
               fired first, and two of the men who had been in the loft said they thought Gifford
               was shot from below, thus intimating that a mistake had been made on the part of
               Gifford's colleagues. The Deputy Sheriff swore, however, that two shots were fired
               from the loft before Gifford was killed, and Henry Bannister, who had been
               immediately behind Gifford, said that as Gifford got his head and shoulders above the
               floor a shot rang out and Gifford fell back into Bannister's arms with about a dozen
               slugs in his head and neck. <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">None of
                  our party</q>, <pb n="215" id="p215" TEIform="pb"/> said Bannister, <q
                  rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">used any violence until Gifford was
                  shot, so far as I could see.</q>

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">67</hi>
               </note> Maillieau, according to the coroner's jury, had been killed by a <q
                  rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">ledden</q> bullet fired by some
               person unknown. In Gifford's case the verdict was directed against the rioters, and
               in the autumn of 1875 the trial began, before Chief Justice Allen, of the nine men
               charged with Gifford's murder. A panel of one hundred and fifty jurors had been
               summoned for the trial. There seems to have been a liberal use of peremptory
               challenges and some difficulty in obtaining men willing to acknowledge <q
                  rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">indifferency</q>. The defence
               claimed that the Honorable Robert Young, a resident of Caraquet and President of the
               Executive Council, frequently consulted with the Attorney General and the Counsel for
               the prosecution regarding the rejection of certain jurors, and that he had been heard
               to say that no Roman Catholic should be on the jury.<note target="n9.68"
                  anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">68</hi>
               </note> The petit jury which was finally selected was composed of Englishmen with one
               exception that is, if the names listed in the original court record are any
               indication.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">From this record we learn that feeling evidently ran high at times during
               the trial. At one point the counsel for the crown was fined fifty dollars for calling
               one of the defence counsels a liar. He paid his fine with a cheque of the Honorable
               George E. King on the Bank of New Brunswick. The Attorney General himself addressed
               the jury for the crown. On December 7 the jury brought in a verdict of guilty against
               Joseph Chasson, the first of the nine men to be tried. The other defendants then
               retracted their plea of not guilty, and pleaded guilty of manslaughter. Judge Allen,
               however, reserved the case for the opinion of the Supreme Court, and postponed
               judgment until after the decision of that Court on a number of points of law in
               connection with the case. On these points of law he asked forty-eight specific
               questions, the greater number of which related to the correctness or incorrectness of
               his action in admitting or rejecting certain evidence. For example, he asked if the
               depositions taken by Coroner Blackball should have been admitted as evidence, since
               Blackball, in lieu of a sworn interpreter, had questioned the witnesses in French and
               translated their answers into English. This meant, so the defence claimed, that these
               statements had been filtered through the mind of a hostile judge.<note target="n9.69"

            </p>


            <p TEIform="p">On a number of points the Judges of the Supreme Court upheld the action
               of Judge Allen; in a considerable number they found that he had been in error; their
               conclusion was that the conviction should be quashed or arrested.<note target="n9.70"

            <p TEIform="p">During the session of the New Brunswick Legislature following the riot the
               subject of the disturbance received but little mention in the House. Beyond the
               remarks already cited in connection with Blanchard's ineffectual effort legalize the
               proceedings of the first school meeting, no reference was made to the riot except
               when the question of a police force and lockup at Caraquet was under discussion. The
               Gloucester members objected strenuously to such a measure and presented petitions
               against it signed by 1500 residents of the county. Burns declared that the people of
               Caraquet were peaceable and law-abiding, as was proved by their record of forty
               years, and that the fact a disturbance had taken place there recently, under very
               peculiar circumstances, did not justify the imposition of the burden proposed.<note

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">73</hi>
               </note> The Government defended the measure on the grounds that Caraquet was forty
               miles from the shiretown, and that the business men of the village wanted to have a
               means of securing small debts, and a place in which to confine the disorderly.
               Finally the Honorable William Kelly asked the House to reflect on what might have
               been saved to the Province and to the people of Caraquet themselves if a lockup and
               police force had been available there a few months before.<note target="n9.74"

            <p TEIform="p">In 1875 the House of Commons once again devoted hours of debate the New
               Brunswick School Law, but Costigan's wish that the subject of the Caraquet

               as that which he had moved and withdrawn the year before. This time, however, in the
               amendment which he suggested to the British North America Act, separate or
               dissentient schools were definitely requested for the Catholics of New Brunswick,
               with exemption from taxation for the support of the public schools.<note

               </note> This fourth resolution of the Costigan series raised many of the same
               questions that the previous resolutions had brought up. The history of school
               legislation in New Brunswick, the constitutional problem involved in interference
               with provincial powers, the claims of the Catholic conscience, the sense of injustice
               which Catholics felt at having to support schools which they could not patronize, the
               Protestant view of the Act as just because it treated all on the same terms&#8212;all
               these subjects were again topics of discussion. The debate, however, had its own
               peculiar features.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">One of these was the appeal which was made to the Liberal party and
               administration. Costigan said that the Catholic population of the country had
               expected that when the Liberal party came in, this question would be satisfactorily
               solved. He hinted that the Honourable gentlemen supporting the Government were

               which he and his friends were supporting would show by their acts that they were
               Reformers not only in name, but in practice, and that wherever they found a law
               operating unjustly toward any class of Her Majesty's subjects, they would come to the

               </note> It would seem, however, that the duty of the Government to uphold the
               Constitution appealed more strongly to the administration than did this challenge to
               their liberal principles. The Prime Minister said he believed in a system of free
               non-denominational schools, but that he could not shut his eyes to the fact that in
               all the Provinces there was a large body of people who believed that dogmas of
               religion should be taught in the Public Schools. He admitted that on a former
               occasion he had voted with those who favored a parliamentary request for disallowance
               of the New Brunswick Act, but since then the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council
               had given its decision. He adhered, he said, to the principle that the House had no
               right to interfere with the legislation of a Province when that legislation was
               secured by an Imperial compact to which all parties had submitted, and he therefore
               felt bound to move an amendment placing on record his views of the federal compact
               and the obligations that rested on the House in connection with it.<note

            <p TEIform="p">The Honourable J. E. Cauchon agreed with the Prime Minister that it was
               dangerous to violate the compact entered into by the several provinces in the Act of
               Confederation. He did think, however, that there had been want of foresight in
               framing that Constitution, for although it secured separate schools to the minority
               in Quebec, the Catholics of New Brunswick were placed on a different footing. He said
               that the Catholics of New Brunswick, if they had known that, would not have agreed to
               Confederation, nor would the Catholics of Lower Canada. Nevertheless he believed that
               an accepted constitution should not be violated even to redress a wrong which should
               have been foreseen and guarded against.<note target="n9.80" anchored="yes"

               which encroached on powers reserved to a Province by the British North America Act
               was an infraction of the Provincial constitution, and was fraught with danger to the
               autonomy of the Provinces, but he did not think that the motion went far enough. He
               therefore added a rider in which the House regretted that the hope expressed by
               Parliament in the resolution of 1872 had not been realized, and recommended an
               address to the Queen praying her to use her influence with the legislature of New
               Brunswick to procure such a modification of the Act of 1871 as would remove the

            <p TEIform="p">Besides these evidences of feeling there was a lack of complete harmony
               among the Catholics themselves, and a difference of opinion as to the course which

               Catholics in New Brunswick, having communicated with the Right Reverend Prelate of
               that Province, who had intimated to him that in his, the Bishop's, opinion Costigan's
               resolution would fail to accomplish the object they had in view, and that it was

               had lied, and called on several Catholic members of the House who had been present at
               a conversation during which they had decided to vote for Cauchon's amendment. Power
               stood up and said he believed then, and still believed that they had the concurrence
               of His Lordship in the course which they took. Flynn corroborated this, and it
               developed that the Bishop had been in Ottawa and that they had met with him several

               to aid the Catholics of New Brunswick. Actually, of course, only in the province
               where the difficulty had arisen could a solution be arrived at, and it is doubtful if
               the interest of Quebec in the whole affair facilitated the eventual settlement.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">The negotiations leading to the compromise extended over several months.
               On August 6, 1875, the Executive Council gave official answer to certain propositions
               which had been submitted to that body by the five Catholic members of the
               Legislature, who assuredly were working for and with Bishop Sweeney in the matter. By
               empowering school trustees to allow the children from any part of a district to
               attend any of the schools within the bounds of the district, provided the regulations
               for grading were observed, the Council granted the first proposition, which, in
               effect, asked that in populous places all the Catholic children might be grouped in
               the same school or schools. The Council gave an affirmative answer to only part of
               the second proposition, that is, they were willing to recognize the certificate of
               the Superior of any Roman Catholic teaching order as a substitute for attendance at
               the Normal School, but not in lieu of an examination for license. The third
               proposition asked that in schools taught by the Christian Brothers and Sisters of
               Charity the teachers should not be compelled to use any books which might contain
               anything objectionable to them in a religious point of view, with particular
               reference to the History and Readers prescribed by the Board of Education. To this
               the Council replied that the greatest care had been taken to keep the school books
               free from matter objectionable to anyone on religious grounds, and that it would be
               the aim of the educational authorities to render the textbooks suitable for all. As
               for the prescribed History of England, the Council said they were prepared to
               recommend to the favorable consideration of the Board of Education the adoption and
               insertion of notes, compiled from Lingard, upon such portions of the text as might be
               deemed objectionable in a religious point of view. The fourth proposition was in
               reference to religious instruction after the regular secular school hours, and
               requested that the said hours should be shortened to the extent allowed for religious
               instruction. The Council in reply referred to that section of the Common Schools Act
               which gave trustees permission to rent <pb n="221" id="p221" TEIform="pb"/> for
               school use buildings belonging to religious orders or to the Roman Catholic Church,
               and intimated that no restriction would be placed upon the use of such buildings
               after the close of the school.<note target="n9.104" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

            <p TEIform="p">These concessions, which, in a sense, legalized within the non-sectarian
               system of the province schools of a sectarian bias, fell short of the demands of the

               in Saint John refused to write examinations for license along with the other
               candidates. Telegrams were exchanged between Rand, who was supervising examinations
               in Fredericton, and his deputy in Saint John, H. C. Creed; the Fredericton members of
               the Board of Education were hastily summoned; and the Premier, J. J. Fraser, wrote
               the former Premier enquiring if the latter had at any time promised Bishop Sweeney a
               separate examination for the Sisters. With King's emphatic denial before them, a full
               meeting of the Board of Education on October 22 went on record against any departure
               from, or annulment of, its former decisions and regulations for the government and
               control of license examinations. But since Rand had authorized Creed at the time of
               the incident to announce at the close of the regular examinations that an adjourned
               session of examinations for license would be held on October 28, the Board, rather
               reluctantly, ratified that exception to the general ruling.<note target="n9.106"

               provincial examinations. All candidates, of course, were to write the same

            <p TEIform="p">After the compromise of 1875, the local opposition of the Catholics to
               the Act of 1871 gradually subsided. We note that in 1876 many school districts were

            <p TEIform="p">During the next fifteen years, while the question of sectarian
               instruction in education vexed the province of Manitoba, New Brunswick was free from
               controversy on this subject, but in the 1890's, at the very time when the Manitoba
               school question was proving even more embarrassing to the Government of the Dominion
               than the New Brunswick issue had been, religious feeling was again aroused in New
               Brunswick. It was excited on this occasion by the claims of the Protestant minority
               in Bathurst and Bathurst Village that the Roman Catholics had been conducting the
               school affairs of that area in contravention of the Act of 1871, and of subsequent
               regulations of the Board of Education. The circumstances which led to these
               allegations were as follows.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">During the period between 1873 and 1890 the Roman Catholics of Bathurst
               Town and Village maintained at their own expense a school in each of those places,
               conducted by Sisters of the Congregation of Notre Dame of Montreal. At these convent
               schools the greater number of the Roman Catholic children of the two communities
               received their education. At the same time there was in each district a school
               conducted under the Common School Act, and supported by assessments levied upon all
               ratable persons in the district, including the Roman Catholics. These schools were
               attended by the Protestant children and by some of the boys of the Catholic faith, as
               the Sisters of the Congregation of Notre Dame did not teach boys. In 1890 the Roman
               Catholics of the two districts concluded it would be better to part with the Sisters,
               who declined to teach under the Common Schools Act, and to secure if possible
               Teaching Sisters who would. Several Sisters of Charity, duly licensed to teach, were
               engaged as teachers, and in September of 1890 certain of the convent school rooms
               were opened as schools under the law. Thus at one stroke the total number of children
               being educated in the public schools was increased by about one hundred and fifty,
               and the sums to be raised by taxation for school purposes were greatly increased to
               meet this increased attendance.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">The situation was complicated by the Roman Catholic observance of holy
               days and by difficulties in the matter of grading, particularly as the trustees
               seemed not unwilling that the convent school rooms should be filled to overflowing
               with Roman Catholic children, while the public school buildings were so sparsely
               filled as to render efficient grading impossible. A further complication arose in
               1892 when the trustees of Bathurst Village, on the score of economy, engaged a French
               female teacher, the holder of a license which was valid only in Acadian districts. In
               consequence, the Protestant children of the primary grades did not attend the school
               for a term, at the end of which time the trustees induced the teacher to resign,
               although she had been engaged for a year. Certain developments early in 1893 in
               connection with the Bathurst Grammar School strained relations between the Catholics
               and Protestants still further. In spite <pb n="223" id="p223" TEIform="pb"/> of the
               consensus of opinion of both the Catholic and Protestant ratepayers at a school
               meeting in January of that year, that the Principal of the Grammar School should be a
               Protestant, a Roman Catholic, son of one of the trustees, was appointed. This
               appointee had been a school inspector, but had been removed from office by the Board
               of Education for inattention to and gross neglect of his duties. <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">The causes which led to this inattention and
                  neglect were well known in Bathurst, and were his habit of life.</q> Moreover, he
               was not the holder of a Grammar School license. The appointment produced intense
               excitement; telegrams were sent to the Chief Superintendent; and the Board of
               Education refused to grant the appointee a Grammar School license. Finally the
               Bathurst trustees appointed a gentleman from Saint John in his stead. In the
               meantime, however, the exasperated Protestant ratepayers had started a private school
               in rented rooms. When this school had been in operation less than a week the owner of
               the rooms declared that he wanted them for other than school purposes, and placed a
               padlock on the door of the building. The next morning, <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">friends of the private school with an axe broke
                  the padlock, and the teacher and pupils entered the school room without any
                  molestation</q>. But the small crowd which had gathered to watch proceedings
               engaged in a half hour of wordy warfare, whereupon two Protestant clergymen of the
               locality telegraphed to the Honorable A. G. Blair, Premier and Attorney General, and
               to H. H. Pitts, the particular champion in the Legislature of the Protestant cause,
               that Bathurst was on the verge of a riot. It happened that Bathurst school matters
               were then under discussion in the Legislature, Pitts having moved for an
               investigation by a select committee of the House of Assembly. Eventually, after a
               heated debate, the House accepted a government resolution to refer the whole matter
               to a judge of the Supreme Court or of the County Courts. Accordingly, on April 18,
               1893, Judge J. J. Fraser of the Supreme Court, formerly a member of the government
               which had made the compromise of 1875, was appointed special commissioner to
               investigate not only all complaints charging infractions of the school law in
               Bathurst and Bathurst Village, but also any and every complaint which might be laid
               before him touching the management of schools in Gloucester County.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">The above account of proceedings in Bathurst, based largely on the
               dispassionate judicial statements of Judge Fraser's report,<note target="n9.112"
                  anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">112</hi>
               </note> gives but a poor idea of the feeling which was aroused throughout the whole
               province. Orangemen beheld a vision of King William leading them on a crusade, the
               partisan press of both sides indulged in extravagant editorials and highly colored
               reports, and inflammatory circulars were distributed in Kent County and York County.
               The language question in relation to the schools was raised on the hustings and in
               the Assembly,<note target="n9.113" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">113</hi>
               </note> numerous petitions signed by about 10,000 persons were presented to the
               Legislature, and in York County, where the fiery and outspoken Pitts seems to have
               made the most of the controversy, the Premier and his entire ticket were defeated in
               the elections of 1892. Charges of catering to the Catho- <pb n="224" id="p224"
                  TEIform="pb"/> lics in order to keep in power were levelled at the government, and
               the Board of Education was accused of making <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified"
                  TEIform="q">secret</q> regulations favoring religious teaching orders, and of not
               acting promptly and efficiently in the Bathurst difficulty. Rumors even linked the
               case with the dismissal from office of Superintendent Crocket,<note target="n9.114"
                  anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">114</hi>
               </note> and the Legislature spent hours discussing the whole question. So thoroughly
               was the subject debated in 1893 that sixty-nine pages of the total one hundred and
               sixty-four pages comprising the Synoptic Report of the Debates for 1893 are devoted
               to the Bathurst school question and related topics.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">A perusal of those pages, and of the debates in 1892 and 1894, give one
               some idea of the pitch to which sectarian feelings were aroused, not only in the
               Legislature but also in the province generally. One is impressed too by the extent to
               which both government and opposition made use of the matter for political purposes.
               There seems to have been almost more anxiety to have the past actions of the
               Government and Board of Education either condemned or condoned than to arrive at a
               solution of the distressing problem, and much time was spent in political manoeuvres
               revolving around the means to be employed in investigating the Protestant complaints
             &#8212;whether by select committee, committee of the whole house, or special
               commissioner. It must be remembered that the Blair administration had been in power
               for ten years, and while shortly before this date it had lost support in Saint John
               City and County over a matter of political patronage, and had had to come to terms
               with the lumbermen of Northumberland County on the question of stumpage, it appeared
               likely to remain secure for many years to come. The opposition, not unnaturally,
               capitalized to the fullest extent on any matter which might harass the government,
               and turned eagerly to this fresh and exciting theme from the monotony of criticizing
               the administration for extravagance.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">While all that was said and written in connection with the affair makes
               interesting reading, Judge Fraser's findings may be regarded as more important. The
               tenor of the fifteen specific complaints submitted to him in writing by the Reverend
               A. F. Thomson was that everything which the trustees and clerics of Bathurst had
               done, or were said to have done, in school matters subsequent to 1890 was in
               violation of the school law, and was motivated by a desire to promote the Catholic
               Church and to injure the Protestant ratepayers. Judge Fraser concluded that the
               evidence did not sustain the specific complaints nor the general allegation. In his
               opinion <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">the trustees of both town
                  and village, in se- <pb n="225" id="p225" TEIform="pb"/> curing for school
                  purposes certain school rooms in the Town Convent building and certain rooms in
                  the Village Convent building, intended that the schools carried on in such
                  buildings should be bona fide carried on and conducted in all respects in
                  accordance with the Common Schools Act and the regulations of the Board of
                  Education</q>. He also thought that the evidence did not sustain the Protestant
               contention that there had been clerical interference with the schools in the town and
               village, and in some of the other school districts of the County of Gloucester,<note
                  target="n9.115" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">115</hi>
               </note> and he doubted that Protestant pupils had been forced by any teacher to kneel
               or cross themselves.<note target="n9.116" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">116</hi>
               </note> He did not hesitate, however, to point out certain misdemeanors and cases of
               mismanagement. For instance, he declared that the action of the trustees of Bathurst
               Village in engaging a teacher of inferior qualifications was objectionable, because
               that teacher, while she was qualified to teach according to her license, was not such
               a teacher as should have been placed in charge of the department to which she was
                  assigned.<note target="n9.117" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">117</hi>
               </note> He also said that from the evidence there could not be a question but that
               the habits of the unpopular appointee to the Grammar School were as well known to the
               trustees as to the ratepayers, <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">and
                  were such as ought to have induced them to say that they could not for a moment
                  listen to any application looking to his appointment</q>.<note target="n9.118"

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">118</hi>
               </note> Moreover, in his judgment, the trustees of both localities had not discharged
               their duties as efficiently as they might have done in regard to grading, having
               tended to fill up the convent buildings to a larger extent than was consistent with
               satisfactory grading in both the public school buildings and the rooms of the
                  convent.<note target="n9.119" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

            </p>

            <p TEIform="p">In regard to religious teaching, Judge Fraser's report indicated that
               from the evidence several teachers in the town and village had given religious
               instruction during the noon hour. The judge interpreted this as an infringement of
               the law, but not a wilful infringement, <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified"
                  TEIform="q">inasmuch as the teachers who so taught the catechism honestly believed
                  that the recreation hour was no part of the teaching day</q>.<note target="n9.120"
                  anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">120</hi>
               </note> Roman Catholic prayers had also been used at the opening and closing of
               school in certain of the schools, but this was not illegal according to a regulation
               then in force. In three or four schools outside the town and village the Roman
               Catholic catechism possibly had been taught during school hours, the instances going
               back as far as 1878. Pointing out that all kinds of irregularities might occur in the
               carrying on of the schools in any county, Judge Fraser declared: <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">Unless they are brought to the notice of the
                  Inspector of Schools for the county, and through him to the notice of the Board of
                  Education, or directly to the notice of the Board of Education itself, it would be
                  manifestly unjust to charge the Board of Education with any dereliction of duty in
                  regard to such irregularities</q>.<note target="n9.121" anchored="yes"

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">121</hi>
               </note> The opinions expressed by Judge Fraser were sustained by Judge Barker <pb

               </note> Pitts, however, was definitely not satisfied, and during the legislative
               session of 1894 he sifted the evidence, questioned Judge Fraser's findings, and urged
               a resolution, justifying the petitioners who had asked for the investigation and
               expressing the belief that all classes and creeds should stand equal before the
                  law.<note target="n9.123" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">123</hi>
               </note> The government, however, blocked this resolution by means of an amendment
               expressing the pleasure of the House at learning from the commissioner's report that
               the Board of Education had not been negligent in the discharge of its duty, and had
               not knowingly permitted any violation of the law. The division on which this
               amendment passed was mainly along party lines.<note target="n9.124" anchored="yes"

            <p TEIform="p">Apparently complete harmony was not at once restored in Bathurst, as
               during the legislative session of 1895 Pitts introduced a resolution expressing
               regret that the school difficulties at Bathurst had not been amicably settled and
               calling on the Board of Education to insist that the dual system of grading be
               abandoned, so that the law might be carried out in its true intent and purpose.<note

               Pitts as unrepresentative of the intelligence, respectability, and benevolent aims of
               the Orange Order, and charged him with bringing up the Bathurst school question so

            <p TEIform="p">In 1896 he commended the minority at Bathurst for not appealing to
               Ottawa, and attempted to bring in a resolution expressing the alarm of the New
               Brunswick Legislature at the promotion at Ottawa of legislation which had in view
               interference with the public school system of Manitoba. However, a seconder of the

               for the first time of the modifications effected in the Act of 1871 by the compromise
               of 1875, and by several subsequent regulations, or had failed until then to realize

               prejudices. Stockton, of the opposition, claimed that when Labillois was campaigning
               in the Kent County elections he had accused Stockton of proposing to him, Labillois,

               telling the French electors in Kent that under the leadership of Stockton and Alward

               strike a blow at the religion and nationality of the French.<note target="n9.138"

               charged the government with being unfair to the French by appointing an Englishman as
               sheriff of the county, and by dismissing a school inspector because he was French,
               and that they had told the French to vote against Labillois because he was partly
               Irish. <pb n="228" id="p228" TEIform="pb"/> He also said that in a conversation with

            <p TEIform="p">Whether these charges and counter-charges were valid or not, they signify
               a recognition of the possibilities for dissension latent in the dual nature of the
               population of the province. Indeed, Premier Blair remarked in 1895 that the school
               difficulties at Bathurst had arisen from the fact of there being not merely two
               religious persuasions in that locality but also two nationalities.<note

               </note> We have observed that Gloucester County, of which Bathurst is the shiretown,
               was predominately French, and that the strongest opposition to the Act of 1871 came
               from the French-speaking counties. Possibly from a thorough investigation of the
               French newspapers of New Brunswick and Quebec during the seventies we should find
               that the question of language was a more important factor in the opposition than is
               commonly thought. Even if religion was the main issue, there are signs that the dual
               elements in the language and culture of the province had become complicating factors
               by the time of the second great controversy. The point is that the Acadians and
               French Canadians of the province were growing steadily in numbers, importance, and
               national consciousness.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">In the early years of the <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified"
                  TEIform="q">Loyalist Province</q> the Acadians had had no part in the official
               life of the colony. It was not until 1842 that they were represented in the
                  Assembly,<note target="n9.141" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">141</hi>
               </note> and previous to 1900 only two of their number were admitted to the provincial
               ministry. At first they were not vocal in English on the subject of their rights and
               privileges, but as their numbers increased they began to press for some official
               recognition of their language. For example, about 1880 there were several requests to
               have the agricultural report printed in French, so that the many farmers among the
               45,000 French of the province might benefit. A resolution passed the House in 1881 in
               favor of compliance with this request,<note target="n9.142" anchored="yes"

               </note> but the government either did not act on the suggestion or carried it out for
               a time only, as in 1890 the Committee on Agriculture, which included four French
                  members,<note target="n9.143" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">143</hi>

               province of the official reports of the debates in the House was also brought up from
               time to time. For example, in 1890 a French-speaking member complained that there was
               no provision regarding the French papers in the memorandum for publishing the
                  debates.<note target="n9.145" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               It was perhaps not difficult for a majority group to exhibit such a spirit toward a
               relatively small minority sensible enough to display a pleasing combination of
               dignity and modesty. We read in the official <pb n="229" id="p229" TEIform="pb"/>

               close on a note of cordiality, to which the sentiments which were aroused by the
               Diamond Jubilee, Canadian participation in the Boer War, and Laurier's emphasis on an
               all-Canadian nationalism appeared as contributory factors. This, of course, does not
               mean that the minority had abandoned their claims for recognition. We note, for
               example, that in 1897 A. D. Richard said in the Assembly that his nationality was not
               as largely represented in the administration of public affairs as it should be. He
               believed, however, that the government would be just enough to grant to every
               nationality and to every class in the province due justice at the proper time and
                  place.<note target="n9.148" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </note> On the other hand, the prevailing good-will in the Legislature does not mean
               that the majority at no time felt uneasiness, although political expediencies usually
               prevented any strong expression of such feeling. Symptomatic, perhaps, was the remark
               of a member in 1881 that the printing of the agricultural reports in French would be
               an entering wedge.<note target="n9.149" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               necessity of conserving the French language in speech and in the schools brought
               forth a protest. The member who protested said that he heartily approved of all that
               had been done to give the Acadians an education in their own language, but that he
               objected to speeches by an officer of the government <q rend="inline"

            <p TEIform="p">Previous to the inauguration of the Free School system, the Acadian
               schools received scant official attention. The larger schools were strictly church or

               </note> the convent schools at Bathurst, and the seminary at Memramcook established
               in 1854. The latter, which later became St. <pb n="230" id="p230" TEIform="pb"/>
               Joseph's University, accepted both French and English students, and, like the
               Wesleyan Academy, received legislative aid more than once before the passage of the
               Common Schools Act. Some of the Acadian districts, like the English-speaking areas,
               were served in the early days by itinerant pedagogues. Later, some supported small
               district schools conducted by teachers who boarded around. Le Gresley implies that
               these Acadian districts did not share in the government allowance until after
                  1847,<note target="n9.153" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </note> but the inclusion of the Acadian schools in the inspection of 1844-45 would
               indicate that some of them may have been in receipt of the provincial grant at an
               earlier date. The inspectors' report stated that for the populous parish of Caraquet
               no part of the government allowance had been drawn for some years, the teachers
               having been deterred from presenting themselves before the Board of Education from a
               consciousness of the want of proper qualifications. The number of Acadian schools was
               not mentioned in this report, but the attainments of the pupils and the
               qualifications of the teachers were referred to as not inferior to those found in the

               in other parts of the province, the report stated: <q rend="inline"

               conducted in the English language and few, if any, of the Acadian teachers attended
               that institution. Perhaps because of that, in 1852 <q rend="inline"

               Inspector Morrison, it will be remembered, complained shortly before the passage of
               the Common Schools Act that the texts used in the Acadian schools were inferior, and
               that it was a mistake not to require the French teachers to attend the Normal School.
               Other official references to these schools were few, and the reports give no
               indication of the extent to which the French language was used in the Acadian
               schools. Le Gresley tells us, however, that the French language held first place
               until 1871.<note target="n9.158" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </note> Neither, it seems, did it infringe upon any. These statements apply equally
               well to New Brunswick. In other words, there was nothing in the Constitution which
               obliged the provincial authorities to accord to the French language any rights and
               privileges in the legislature or in the schools, nor were they placed under any
               compulsion to restrict the use of French as the language of communication and study
               in the schools of Acadian districts. Those who framed the Act of 1871, opposed as
               they were to the separation of children on religious grounds, no doubt considered
               separation on the grounds of language an obstacle to a unified system, but if there
               was serious thought on the matter, and it is difficult to find evidences of any, the
               attitude probably was the same as that attributed by C. B. Sissons to Ryerson of

               </note> The Act of 1871 said nothing whatever about the use of the French language,
               and in the thinking of the educationists of the time the emphasis, either deliberate
               or unconscious, seems to have been on the promotion of education through the medium
               of the English language. However, since the provincial system already included
               Acadian schools, it was taken for granted that the use of the French language might
               be continued under the Common Schools Act in the elementary schools of Acadian
               districts, and subsequent to the Act various regulations and provisions were made
               from time to time with reference to such schools. Le Gresley states that the Acadians
               accepted these arrangements as a makeshift, satisfactory enough from a relative point
               of view.<note target="n9.161" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </note> Thus controversy on the score of language did not arise, and during the
               nineteenth century, if there was dissatisfaction among the Acadians, it was not
               expressed so strongly as to engage the attention of the educational authorities.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">Regulation 16 of the Regulations of the Board of Education, published
               November 15, 1871, included elementary French readers in a list of school texts

               selecting any that might be suitable and necessary for use in the French districts of
               New Brunswick. A few months later a committee was appointed to examine two texts,
               Grammaire Elementaire française and Introduction au traite d'Arithmétique
               Commerciale. On January 8, 1877, the grammar was prescribed, and, rather curiously,
               the arithmetic for both English and French pupils, if it was preferred to the

               Legislature of <pb n="232" id="p232" TEIform="pb"/> Maine had authorized the

               Poirier, an Acadian scholar and politician, and Professor Rivet of the University of
               New Brunswick, with a revision of the texts of the French-English readers; adopted
               the revisions; and ordered the Superintendent to communicate with the publishers of

            <p TEIform="p">This repetition of the term French-English emphasizes the fact that the
               so-called French schools were not separate language schools, but were bilingual
               schools, in which the primary pupils, whose vernacular was French, might learn both
               French and English, until they reached a point at which they could continue their
               education in the English language.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">Bilingual teachers were, therefore, a necessary part of the scheme. Until
               1884 almost all the French-speaking teachers were untrained. In 1878 Superintendent
               Rand recommended to the Board of Education the establishment of a Preparatory
               Department of the Normal School for the benefit of such French students as might not
               be prepared for admission to the regular classes, and the Board ordered that such a
               department be opened in November. Those students who passed, at the close of the
               session, an examination equivalent to that required for admission to the existing
               department of the Normal School were to receive a license of the third class valid
               for two years.<note target="n9.167" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">167</hi>
               </note> Later the license was made valid for three years and the period of attendance
               was reduced from five months to three months.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">On the whole, the benefits of this department do not seem to have been
               very great. After it was discontinued in 1884 Superintendent Crocket wrote: <q
                  rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">During the five and a half years of
                  its existence it had done nothing towards the training of its students, nor was it
                  established with this view. It gave good instruction in the elementary branches to
                  those who did attend, but not any better than they ought to receive in a
                  well-taught District School . . . . It was left to their option to enter the
                  Normal Department if found qualified, or to accept a temporary license for three
                  years on the understanding that when it expired they were to return to the Normal
                  School for training. In all cases they accepted the license, but with one or two
                  exceptions they did not return, and many of them are now teaching as local
                  licensees. But the numbers who did attend were so small that it would have taken
                  very many years, even if they had all continued to teach, before their influence
                  could have been much felt in the French schools. During its existence the total
                  number who attended was <pb n="233" id="p233" TEIform="pb"/> only 113, including
                  several whose scholarship was so limited that they were required to attend a
                  second term, thus giving an average attendance per term of about 7</q>.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">Continuing, the Superintendent said that some other provision was seen to
               be necessary, <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">whereby these Acadian
                  students could be trained as well as instructed, and receive a permanent license
                  on the same footing as the others. Only by some such provision can we hope to
                  elevate the French schools and make them the compeers of the English</q>. He then
               described the set-up of a new French Department presided over by Alphie Belliveau,
               who had been Principal of the Preparatory Department. The students, he said, received
               instruction only in professional subjects from the Principal of the Normal School,
               but if they were deemed sufficiently well qualified to be presented at the close of
               the term for examination for license in advance of class three, they received both
               professional and academic instruction in the English department. At the close of the
               term they were examined for license on the same subjects as were prescribed for the
               other candidates, but an additional paper in French was set for all French
               candidates, for which they received credit by adding the examiner's estimate upon it
               to the other estimates without including the subject in the divisor.<note

            <p TEIform="p">The conditions under which teachers trained in this French Department
               might be employed, if not clearly defined before 1897, were definitely set forth in
               that year, possibly because of an echo of the Bathurst school case. In October, 1897,
               the Board received letters from Inspector Mersereau and the Reverend A. F.
                  Thomson<note target="n9.169" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               meeting of the ratepayers of district No. 2, Bathurst, in reference to the employment
               of a French teacher for the primary grades of the school of that district. Thereupon
               the Board ordered the Superintendent to direct the trustees of the district to employ
               only such teachers as had received a provincial license after having passed through
               the course of training provided for the English teachers in the Normal School. The
               superintendent was further ordered to prepare for the consideration of the Board a
               regulation defining the conditions under which teachers who had received licenses
               after attendance at the French department of the Normal School might be
                  employed.<note target="n9.170" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               the English department, should be employed only in Acadian districts, or in districts
               in which the French language was the language in common use by a majority of the
               people, unless the written consent of the Chief Superintendent should be obtained.
               Moreover, no such teacher was to be employed in any district, Acadian or otherwise,
               if the Superintendent notified the trustees of the district that no such teacher

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">174</hi>
               </note> The educational authorities, however, quite consistently lamented that the
               number of those who annually graduated from the French department was never
               sufficient to supply the Acadian districts with trained teachers. In 1894
               Superintendent Inch pointed out that nearly one-half the schools in Madawaska County
               were still taught by untrained teachers. He said he was convinced that the fault lay
               largely with the people, who seemed unwilling to incur the expense of sending their
               sons and daughters to the Normal School while they could succeed in obtaining for
               them local licenses. In this way they kept their schools open at little or no expense
               to the district, the provincial grant and county fund supplying nearly all the salary
               paid in many cases. He declared that a constant effort had been made for several
               years to reduce the number of local licenses granted, but that the unpleasant
               alternative continued to present itself of either closing the schools or yielding to
               the importunities of those who pleaded for the local license.<note target="n9.175"

               the Acadian areas displayed a greater general apathy in educational affairs than the
               majority of other rural areas, but we may note that occasionally the inspectors made
               special reference to these districts as educationally backward. For example, in 1883
               Inspector Landry reported that in one district in Caraquet over sixty children were
               running about the streets, and in Caraquet Centre there was no proper school for over
               one hundred children. The trustees, he said, were to blame, having failed to attend

               the population was wholly or predominately French. He said that it was immaterial to
               him whether the appointee was a Frenchman, Englishman, Irishman or Scotchman, so long
               as he had the essential qualification of being able to speak both languages. In reply
               the Honorable L. J. Tweedie said that if it was considered advisable to increase the
               number of inspectors at any time, the question of appointing an inspector knowing

               that the only proper channel through which they could become masters of both
               languages was through their mother tongue. Poirier also asked the Government to give
               the French children <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">a series of

            <p TEIform="p">A survey made a short time afterwards of the bilingual schools of Ontario
               showed that a very small number of children educated in those schools ever attempted
               the entrance examinations, a still smaller number succeeded, and the number who ever
               attended any of the high schools of the province reached almost a vanishing
                  point.<note target="n9.182" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

            <p TEIform="p">A thorough investigation of the condition and results of the bilingual
               schools of New Brunswick has not yet been made. We find that during the period under
               consideration the Inspectors seldom even referred to the difficulties peculiar to
               these schools. A notable exception was Inspector Philip Cox, afterwards a professor
               at the University of New Brunswick, who emphasized the obstacles in the French
               schools to the teaching of the higher standards, <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">where, the Text Books being in English, the
                  teachers are obliged to do much extra work, translating from one language to
                  another, in order to render passages, ideas, and problems, otherwise obscure,
                  plain and intelligible to the pupils. Neither can the latter, owing to their
                  limited knowledge of English, make anything like an intelligent preparation of
                  lessons in advance of recitation.</q>
               <note target="n9.183" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">183</hi>
               </note> The next year he stressed this matter again, saying: <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">With the exception of texts on Arithmetic and
                  Grammar, a Primer, and Nos. 1, 2 and 3 French English Readers, there are no
                  authorized French books for these schools. History, geography, Composition,
                  Geometry, Physics, Botany and Chemistry must now be studied in a tongue but poorly
                  understood, a circumstance that makes the inherent difficulties of these subjects
                  still harder to be grappled with and understood. Moreover, <pb n="236" id="p236"
                     TEIform="pb"/> whatever opinions may be held respecting the knowledge of the
                  language to be obtained from the Readers referred to, all must agree that to stop
                  at this stage is only closing the doors against the pupils acquiring an
                  acquaintance with the idiomatic and classic beauty of their native tongue. For
                  these and other reasons it would seem desirable to have the list of authorized
                  French Text Books enlarged.</q>

            </p>

            <p TEIform="p">In the light of these remarks one is impressed by the interesting
               possibilities of research on the question of illiteracy in French districts. Was the
               economic factor of prime importance? How much significance may be attached to the
               question of faulty texts and inadequately trained teachers? To what extent were the
               teachers hampered by the necessity of having to teach the elementary grades in both
               languages? What correlation was there between the drop in school attendance and the
               transfer to an all-English programme of studies at the close of the elementary
               grades? No attempt was made during the nineteenth century to find answers to these
               questions, and the problem of backward schools in Acadian districts, if it was
               recognized as a problem separate from that of general rural education, was passed on
               as a legacy to the twentieth century. In fact one may say that no scientific study of
               the problem has yet been made. It may be that this question, like the question of
               general rural education, will demand particular attention in the near future.</p>

                  point. In the trial which followed, the Crown tried to show that because of the
                  rioting which had preceded the events of January twenty-seventh the party in
                  hiding knew that they were liable to arrest and had therefore conspired to resist.
                  The Defence contended that the shooting was done in self-defence, that some of the
                  Sheriff's men had been rough in making arrests on the morning of January
                  twenty-seventh, that the whole village had been terrified by <q rend="inline"

                  record of the inquest on the body of Gifford. The testimony of the witnesses at
                  the trial is not included in the court record, but from Judge Allen's references
                  to the case when he submitted it to the Supreme Court, we learn that one of the
                  constables testified that the first shot was by the Sheriff's party, straight up
                  through the trap, to frighten the men above. The next shot came from the loft and
                  struck the stove. When several of the attacking party gained the loft there were
                  shots from the men there, who had retreated to one corner. Then Gifford was shot.
                  (Ibid., p. 558), Gifford's pistol, when found afterwards, had one chamber empty.
                  (Ibid. pp. 564, 565). Clearly, the shot which killed Gifford was not the first

                  sent one of his sons to a Catholic institution at a distance and one daughter to a
                  convent, but that his means did not allow him to do the like for the rest of his
                  family. Since there was a good school established by law within reach, and
                  presided over by a gentleman of high character, he had decided it was better to
                  send the rest of his children there than to have them go uneducated. He believed
                  he had done right under the circumstances, but he did not wish his conduct to be
                  taken as an indication of approval by him of the school law. Ibid., p. 628.</note>

                  from office in 1870, true also that he had attempted to initiate an investigation
                  into complaints by Protestants against the Arichat (convent) public school, but
                  two other factors seem to have been involved in his dismissal, neither of which
                  had any sectarian implications. In the first place, there was a fundamental
                  antagonism between Rand and the Liberal Government of Nova Scotia, particularly on
                  the question of the relationship between himself as Superintendent and the Council
                  of Public Instruction. Secondly, Rand and the Council did not see eye to eye in
                  the "George affair", an incident which took its name from the Inspector who was
                  involved. (Laidlaw, A. F., "Theodore Harding Rand," Nova Scotia Journal of

                  attempted to move an amendment to Cauchon's rider, but had been ruled out of order
                  by Speaker Anglin. The New Brunswick Reporter claimed that Anglin's constituents
                  in Northern New Brunswick felt he had been party to a conspiracy to allow Cauchon
                  to catch his eye before Baby, although the latter gentleman had the floor first.
                  The Reporter concluded from this, and from The Freeman's description of Costigan's
                  speech as indiscreet, that Anglin, mindful of his position as Speaker of the House
                  of Commons, had executed something of a volte face on the New Brunswick school
                  question. The Reporter prophesied that as a result of the indignation which this
                  had excited among his constituents Anglin was <q rend="inline"

                  effect that Crocket had been dismissed because he was too friendly to the Roman
                  Catholics of Bathurst. (See New Brunswick: Synoptic Report of Debates of House of
                  Assembly, 1892, p. 14). Another rumor said that his services had been dispensed
                  with because he was not liberal enough towards the Catholics. (Ibid., p. 16). We
                  should add, perhaps, that other reasons, not connected with the difficulty at
                  Bathurst, were also mentioned. The opposition claimed that because the sons of the
                  ex-Superintendent had refused to support Premier Blair in their newspaper their
                  father's dismissal was decided upon. Blair, forced to make some comment on the
                  retirement, said that the government and Crocket could not get along together,
                  that perhaps blame rested on both sides, but that circumstances did occur under
                  which the former Superintendent had not considered it his duty to consult with the
                  government on matters of public business which should have been placed before the
                  government months before. (Ibid., p. 69). Possibly these <q rend="inline"

               DEMOCRACY</head>


            <p TEIform="p">The Act which laid the foundation of a free school system represented the
               most significant educational advance in New Brunswick during the nineteenth century.
               It meant, in effect, that the province subscribed to the doctrine of <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">schools for all</q>, but when the century ended
               the ideal of <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">all at school</q> was
               still far from realization<note target="n10.1" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">1</hi>
               </note>, and the idea had scarcely more than dawned that diversities in environment,
               in ability, in tastes, and in vocation should be taken into consideration in
               providing universal education. Moreover, although the right of every child to an
               education was no longer questioned, the old laissez-faire idea of every man for
               himself persisted, in that the clever and ambitious child, if poor, was left to make
               his own way in the face of inequality of opportunity.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">Within the framework of the Act there was, of course, much commendable
               progress, less perhaps in the growth of ideas than in the development of order and
               administrative efficiency. Investigation shows that the greater part of the items on
               the agenda of the Board of Education between the years 1872 and 1900 related to such
               matters as enquiries from inspectors and teachers on minor points of law, requests
               from boards of school trustees for permission to levy taxes for school purposes and
               to borrow money for the building of new schools, the laying off of new districts, the
               settlement of local disputes involving the location of school buildings and the
               division of districts, the removal of delinquent trustees, the selection of school
               texts, and the framing of regulations regarding the time, place, and scope of
               examinations for Normal School entrance and for school licenses. The general tendency
               of the deliberations and decisions arising out of these matters was in the direction
               of that order and system without which progress is difficult, but the number and
               exacting nature of routine items seem to have discouraged consideration by the Board
               of broad educational principles, interesting experiments, and important trends. This
               is not to say that the Chief Superintendent, occupied though he was with
               administrative details, was unaware of movements and ideas outside the province or
               was unimpressed by their implications for New Brunswick, but the fiscal weakness of
               the province, the preoccupation of the government with questions of politics, finance
               and transportation, and the popular tendency to jog placidly along in the old ways
               combined, as earlier, to postpone the adoption of many forward-looking
               suggestions.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">Two examples will serve to illustrate this point. Even before the
               inauguration of the free school system, the idea of a scheme of pensions for teachers
               had been favorably commented upon by Superintendent Bennet.<note target="n10.2"
                  anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">2</hi>
               </note> During the <pb n="238" id="p238" TEIform="pb"/> next thirty years the
               maintenance of an adequate supply of experienced teachers was rendered particularly
               difficult by the wave of emigration which drained New Brunswick of its young people,
               including many potential teachers. There was therefore a particularly obvious need of
               some inducement to young people to make teaching their life work. The Superintendent
               and Inspectors from time to time spoke of the advantages to the profession of some
               provision for aged and infirm teachers, the teachers themselves petitioned the
                  government,<note target="n10.3" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">3</hi>
               </note> the Board of Education got as far as appointing a committee to enquire into
               the feasibility of such a plan,<note target="n10.4" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">4</hi>
               </note> and eventually in the Legislature P. J. Veniot and J. D. Chipman advocated a
               superannuation fund for teachers,<note target="n10.5" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">5</hi>
               </note> but when the century ended a pension scheme for teachers was still not an
               accomplished fact. As Professor Walter C. Murray said in addressing the faculty and
               students of the University of New Brunswick in 1899, American democracy unfortunately
               was opposed to the granting of pensions on principle, the feeling being that a man
               should provide by economy, insurance, or investment, for his old age, no matter what
               his calling.<note target="n10.6" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </note>
            </p>

            <p TEIform="p">Our second example is even more interesting and illuminating. Marshall
               d'Avray, it will be remembered, as early as 1847 suggested the inclusion of manual
               training in the school curriculum, but it was not until 1900 that steps were taken in
               this direction, and possibly only then because of an impetus from without. Sir
               William Macdonald, benefactor of the Technical School at McGill, offered in 1899 to
               pay for the equipment required for educational manual training in one centre of every
               province of the Dominion, to meet the expenses of qualifying teachers for the new
               course, and to maintain the schools for three years.<note target="n10.7"
                  anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">7</hi>
               </note> Professor J. W. Robertson, who had done so much previously to assist the
               provincial authorities in the promotion of dairy farming and in the establishment of
               butter and cheese factories, was entrusted with the task of organizing these manual
               training schools. Thus a department, known at first as the Sloyd<note target="n10.8"
                  anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">8</hi>
               </note> School, was established at Fredericton where the young men of the Normal
               School could undergo the new training, and eventually the provincial government
               offered a special grant to certified teachers giving instruction in manual training,
               and undertook to pay 20% of the necessary equipment for manual training in any
                  school.<note target="n10.9" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">9</hi>
               </note> The adoption of this training for boys naturally facilitated the introduction
               of household science for girls, but for obvious reasons the new programme became a
               feature of urban schools only&#8212;in fact <pb n="239" id="p239" TEIform="pb"/> nearly
               another half century was to elapse before any serious effort was made to provide
               rural children with opportunities for acquiring training in the manual and household
               arts.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">The course of education in New Brunswick between 1871 and 1900, aside
               from the problems and complications which arose in connection with religion and
               language, must be viewed in relation to the economic and political life of the
               province during that period, for the trend, the temper and the tempo of developments
               were bound to be affected, directly or indirectly, by the limitations of provincial
               revenue and the extent of public works programmes, by the relation between emigration
               and immigration, by trade cycles and Dominion policies, and by many other
               circumstances. When developments are viewed in this light, one readily establishes a
               rough correlation between recognizable periods in the educational history of the
               province and distinct phases in its economic history.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">The Golden Age of Maritime prosperity lingered on into the seventies.
               During that decade the economy of New Brunswick was not yet adversely affected to a
               large degree by the application of iron and steel and steam to methods of
               transportation, and was yet to feel the full effects of the growing industrial
               expansion of the central provinces. Moreover, emigration had not yet become an acute
               problem&#8212;indeed there was still the hope of a large increase in population through
               immigration. As Professor Murray said in 1899, when he pointed to the consolidation
               of schools as a remedy for the many poor and thinly settled school districts, the
               school reformers of the seventies, in deciding on four square miles as the limit of a
               school district, evidently expected the wastes of the province to be filled up in a
               short time.<note target="n10.10" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">10</hi>
               </note> The general optimism and enthusiasm engendered by the consummation of
               Confederation and by the extension of railways had their counterparts in educational
               circles. The establishment at long last of a free school system gave rise to a sense
               of achievement, fostered a belief in the future, and created enthusiasm and
               determination for the immediate task of organization. This spirit pulsed through the
               reports submitted by the Superintendent and Inspectors and found remarkable
               expression in the reports from the boards of trustees of urban districts. Taking as
               examples the reports for 1874 from Saint John and Fredericton, one is impressed by
               the evidence of an extraordinary interest in education and by the thought and labour
               that the trustees had expended on everything relating to the schools of their
               respective cities. Clearly, the men who composed these boards had caught a vision of
               themselves as educationists. The report submitted by the Fredericton Board, as
               printed in the Journal of the Assembly for 1875, covers twenty-two pages, and deals
               not only with the question of buildings and equipment but also with such matters as
               the propriety of giving school prizes, the question of corporal punishment, and the
               arrangements which the Board had made for the introduction of Industrial Art Drawing.
               The report also gives an outline of the course of instruction for every grade, and
               includes extracts from the report of the Superin- <pb n="240" id="p240" TEIform="pb"
               /> tendent of the city schools. Principal Crocket of the Normal School, who frankly
               described the work of each teacher employed. Perhaps most significant of all is the
               recognition accorded by the Board to certain principles as essential to successful
                  teaching.<note target="n10.11" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">11</hi>
               </note> Undoubtedly the members of this Board had familiarized themselves with the
               pedagogical writings of Pestalozzi! </p>

            <p TEIform="p">The report from the Board of Trustees of Saint John is also lengthy, and
               reveals the fact that the Board had held twenty-three meetings during the year and
               had discussed <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">everything connected
                  with the management of the Public Schools in every department</q>. From the report
               of the Superintendent of City Schools, John Bennet, formerly the Superintendent of
               Education for the province, we learn that the Board had been concerned with such
               matters as evening schools, monthly home reports, regularity of attendance, the
               importance of music as a branch of education, the introduction of the new subject,
               drawing, and the improvement of the teaching in the Primary Schools through the use
               of object-lessons.<note target="n10.12" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">12</hi>
               </note> It is no wonder that Superintendent Rand, in paying tribute to the
               intelligence and spirit of the school trustees in incorporated towns and cities,
               observed that his remarks had <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">a
                  special fulness of application to the Trustees of the District of the City of
                  Saint John</q>.<note target="n10.13" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">13</hi>
               </note>
            </p>


            <p TEIform="p">From the first, Superintendent Rand emphasized the fact that much more
               depended on the teachers than on the buildings and equipment, essential though the
               latter were. He was therefore greatly distressed that in spite of the scarcity of
               trained teachers many applicants for training had to be rejected because of the
               limited accommodation in the old Normal School, and he constantly urged the necessity
               of a new building. When the Legislature in 1876 responded to a stirring speech by
               William Elder, editor of the Saint John <hi rend="italic" TEIform="hi"
               >Telegraph</hi>, and decided to spend $ 50,000 for a new Normal School, Rand gave
               Elder's speech publicity in the Educational Circular<note target="n10.14"
                  anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">l4</hi>
               </note>, and in his own address<note target="n10.15" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">15</hi>
               </note> at the inaugural exercises of the new school intimated that the building
               would play an important part in elevating the quality of the instruction given in the
               schools of the province.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">As another means of effecting this object Rand planned at an early date
               to use the ranking system, having outlined the scheme at length in his report for
                  1872<note target="n10.16" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">16</hi>
               </note>. The plan was to come into effect in 1877, but so onerous was the task of
               organization during these years of transition that it was not until 1879 that a
               complete and graded course of instruction, based on uniform texts, was perfected, and
               all the schools could be ranked according to the quality of the work done by the
               teacher. We may presume that Rand had become acquainted with this idea during his
               visit to Great Britain in 1871,<note target="n10.17" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">17</hi>
               </note> for the ranking plan, known there as <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified"
                  TEIform="q">payment-by-results</q>, was popular in that country at the time. <pb
                  n="241" id="p241" TEIform="pb"/> The device, one of the entering wedges of state
               control in England, had come into use about 1861, and afforded state grants based on
               the results of individual inspection and examination in reading, writing and
               arithmetic. Under this impetus teachers became more industrious and managers and
               pupils showed new life.<note target="n10.18" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">18</hi>
               </note> Rand's application of the plan in New Brunswick was designed to discourage
               teachers from frequently changing their schools, to encourage regularity of school
               attendance, and to reward efficiency in teaching. To be eligible for classification,
               the school must have been conducted by the teacher for more than one term, and the
               teacher had to present for examination at least the average number of pupils in
               attendance for the term, an average not less than 60% of the total enrolment. The
               school or department was to be classified by the Inspector as being of the first rank
               if not less than 75% of the pupils presented for examination had passed, and not less
               than 60% of each class. For schools of the second rank the corresponding percentages
               were to be sixty and fifty, and for schools of the third rank fifty and forty.<note

               In other words, the plan left ample room for the recognition of every form of

                  TEIform="q">talented indolence</q>, and discouraged teachers from neglecting any
               one subject through over attention to a favorite study. Besides the ordinary
               provincial grants which teachers received according to their sex and license,
               teachers whose schools were classified were henceforth to receive an additional grant
               in terms of the ranking accorded to their schools at the time of the inspectoral

               deal of misunderstanding of the plan at first and that many teachers regarded it with
               disfavor, but the Superintendent did not doubt that if all cooperated, it would
               result in an immense improvement in the quality of the work done in all the

            <p TEIform="p">Through the medium of the Educational Circular, Rand sought to inspire
               teachers and trustees and to keep them informed on educational matters. These
               semi-annual publications contained official notices and much information and advice.
               The Superintendent also enthusiastically promoted County Institutes and made a
               provincial Educational Institute a regular feature, believing it to be a <q

            <p TEIform="p">Finally, during this period of reform and enthusiasm Rand repeatedly
               urged the adoption of means to improve the secondary education of the province. At
               the opening of the new Normal School he intimated that the impetus in this direction
               must come from the government, for he quoted John Stuart Mill at follows: 'The
               uncultivated cannot be judges of cultivation. Those who need most to be made wiser
               and better usually desire it least, and if they desired it, would be incapable of
               finding their way to it by their own light . . . . Any well-intentioned and tolerably
               civilized government may think, without presumption, that it does and ought to
               possess a degree of cultivation above the average of the community which it rules,
               and that it should therefore be capable of offering better education and better
               instruction to the people than the greater number of them would spontaneously
                  elect.'<note target="n10.27" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">27</hi>
               </note> However, in spite of Rand's solicitations, no reforms were effected in the
               secondary education of the province until the middle of the eighties, beyond a
               stiffening of the regulations governing the requirements for a Superior
                  allowance,<note target="n10.28" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">28</hi>
               </note> a change which increased the requirements for the receipt of the allowance
               but at the same time widened for a greater number of districts the opportunities of
               earning the grant, since heretofore only one school in each parish could receive such
               a bonus.</p>

            <p TEIform="p">At the beginning of the eighties the Superintendent referred regretfully
               to the industrial depression which was responsible for the closing of schools in some
               areas and for a reduction in the local salaries paid to teachers.<note
                  target="n10.29" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">29</hi>
               </note> He was hopeful, however, that the situation was only temporary. It is true
               that at the close of the seventies business was particularly poor, but actually there
               could be no complete recovery, for in industry as well as in education the decade
               following Confederation had been a transitional period, but with this difference&#8212;
               the change had been for the worse, not for the better. Throughout the eighties and
               early nineties times continued difficult, partly because of depressed trade
               elsewhere, partly because of the disastrous effects on the provincial economy of the
               passing of wood and canvas from the sea-lanes of the world. The earlier hopes of a
               gain in population through immigration were abandoned, and the retention of native
               stock, rather than the attraction of immigrants, became the chief object of measures
               to develop the industries and resources of the province, especially after the census
               of 1891 had revealed the alarming extent of the drift in population to the United
               States and to other parts of Canada.<note target="n10.30" anchored="yes"

               </note> While the provincial debt soared, largely as the result of a sectional
               scramble for railways, the educational services of the province suffered from various

            <p TEIform="p">One of the first things which the Blair administration did was to order

               </note> The tendency of local boards of trustees to compete, not for the most
               competent teachers but for the cheapest, that is, those whose limited training and
               knowledge entitled them to the lowest class of license, became more pronounced than
               ever during this period, and even the government grants to teachers were reduced at
               the time of the abolition of the ranking system. The financial saving effected by the
               discontinuance of bonuses to classified schools was not, of course, the only reason
               for the abolition of this system. We are told that in England <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">payment-by-results</q> meant that 'the child
               became a money-earning unit to be driven; the teacher a sort of foreman whose

               </note> that it perverted the inspectors from their true duties, made the lives and
               livings of teachers anxious and precarious, tended to reduce school work to a
               mechanical drill, forced students into examinations in defiance of the laws of
               health, and developed such a sentiment that 'failure caused not regret but
               indignation at the child'.<note target="n10.34" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </note> In four years the system could not lead to the evils in New Brunswick that
               thirty years of operation caused in Great Britain, but obviously the plan was open to
               criticism. Certainly it added to the work of the inspectors,<note target="n10.35"
                  anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">35</hi>
               </note> and it is doubtful if those officials could arrive at a fair estimate of the
               progress of a school in the few hours they could devote to its examination. If, for
               any reason, they failed to visit a school, then the teacher and the district lost the
               opportunity of earning the bonus. We note that during the operation of the plan the
               Board of Education received many complaints from teachers whose schools had not been
               visited, or had not received the ranking to which the teachers thought they were

               and when Rand had resigned to become a member of the staff at Acadia College, the way
               was clear for its abolition. Indeed, his successor, William Crocket, questioned the
               value of the system and suggested that it be discontinued.<note target="n10.37"

               under the plan were smaller than the maximum grants which teachers had been able to
               earn under the ranking system. It is only fair to observe that a number of the
               legislators of the province expressed concern over this reduction,<note

               </note> but there is significance in the Premier's remark that the government felt it
               had reached the extent of the financial ability of the country when it placed the

               reflected the pinched times&#8212;pitiful offences such as the alteration of a school
               draft from $ 9.83 to $ 25.83, <note target="n10.40" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               in the profession. That at least a minimum of service might be obtained from trained
               teachers the practice was initiated in 1872 of exacting from every student-teacher at
               the Normal School a promise to teach in New Brunswick or forfeit the sum the trainee

               required to promise that if he did not teach, he would report to the Superintendent
               his reasons for failing to do so, and would consider himself under a moral obligation

               as the girl who asked to be relieved from the obligation to repay the Board for her

            <p TEIform="p">During this decade and a half, discussion in the legislature of
               educational topics seldom failed to elicit some form of protest against the cost, and
               periodically members registered their conviction that the state should not seek to
               provide anything but an elementary education. In the Legislative Council the session
               of 1880 witnessed a lively attack on the educational system as expensive and
               burdensome. The attitude of this body of the Tory tradition seemed to be: <q

                  teaching of the three R's, and a child, if he has ability and perseverance, will

               affairs should be rendered practical and economical, and the conclusion stated that
               whenever such management should be found to be impractical, or too expensive, or
               unadapted to the circumstances and needs of the country, measures of reform would

               </note> It is true that other considerations besides the need for economy prompted
               much of the criticism of the period. We note, for instance, a growing conviction that
               the needs of a large proportion of society were not being met, and the presence of a
               sentiment against the taxation of the <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified"

               values may have been at fault, for railway deficits were accepted as the inevitable
               toll of progress, while a slight deviation from the most modest of school budgets was
               viewed with disapproval, even alarm. Nevertheless, one cannot avoid the conclusion
               that during these lean years the financial stringencies of the province, either
               through sheer necessity or through a species of rationalization, conditioned both
               practices in education and the thought-processes behind the practices.</p>

               national economy&#8212;shared to some extent in the new prosperity and in these
               sentiments. If the decline of the wooden shipbuilding industry and the extension of

               officials. Thus improvements in trade and industry hastened the hitherto slow
               response of the province to the newer trends in education.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">During this whole period of thirty years, progress in education, while
               largely conditioned by the economic factor, was not uninfluenced by the dominant
               trends of the time. One of the most outstanding of these was an interest in science.
               In the civilized world at large science dominated the spirit of the age, appearing
               not only as an <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">instrument of
                  culture</q>
               <note target="n10.64" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">64</hi>
               </note> but as the means by which man could make his environment yield him wealth and
               comfort. Increasingly, the application of science to industry, transportation,
               agriculture, health, sanitation, and education, wrought great changes. While for
               obvious reasons the process of change was neither early nor rapid in New Brunswick,
               it nonetheless occurred as inevitably as the distant creek is eventually flooded by
               the incoming tide.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">From the educational viewpoint the cause of science was ably represented
               in the province during this period in the person of Loring Woart Bailey. A son of the
               American scientist, Jacob Whitman Bailey, he had grown to manhood in an atmosphere of
               science and on terms of familiarity with the great scientists of the day. At Harvard
               he had studied with Louis Agassiz, Asa Gray, and other eminent scientists, and
               graduated in the year of the publication of Darwin's, <q rend="inline"
                  direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">Origin of Species</q>, coming to New Brunswick
               two years later, in 1861. From <pb n="247" id="p247" TEIform="pb"/> his father and
               his teachers he had caught the spirit of the new scientific age and it was a matter
               of significance that he was at that time brought into close relationship with New
               Brunswick's educational system. Although in himself a one-man department of science
               at the University of New Brunswick, he found time to become well acquainted, through
               private excursions and Dominion surveys, with the flora, the fauna, and the geologic
               formations of the province, the latter hitherto almost unexplored. As a newspaper
               article said at the time of his death, <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified"
                  TEIform="q">he has left his mark on the scientific history of the Dominion; but

            <p TEIform="p">The addresses and lessons on the agenda of teachers' institutes during
               these years indicate an increasing recognition of the claims of science on the part
               of the teaching profession. As time went on it was a rare convention which did not
               feature at least one paper or lesson, either to add to the teachers' knowledge of
               some scientific subject, or to suggest better methods of teaching science. Perhaps
               the most interesting example, however, of enthusiasm for science among the teachers
               of the province was the Summer School of Science, established in 1887. This school, a
               voluntary organization, inter-provincial in its character, was held in annual
               sessions for several weeks in various centres ranging from Yarmouth in southwestern
               Nova Scotia to Campbellton in northern New Brunswick. Lectures, discussions,
               laboratory and field work, and excursions to local points of scientific or historical
               interest were features of the school. While such courses were given as literature,
               elocution, music, psychology, and pedagogy, scientific subjects received the greatest
               emphasis. In 1893, for instance, there were courses of lectures on astronomy, botany,
               chemistry, mineralogy, geology, physics, physiology, and zoology.<note

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">70</hi>
               </note> and eventually the governments of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick each gave a
               small annual grant, with Prince Edward Island following suit later. Sometimes, too,
               the people of the locality where the school was held made a donation. For example, in
               1900 the citizens of Bear River, Nova Scotia, gave one hundred dollars.<note

               Council of Public Instruction in allowing an additional week of vacation to teachers

               privilege to the rural teachers of New Brunswick, whose normal holiday was only six
                  weeks.<note target="n10.72" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </note> The attendance of teachers from New Brunswick naturally varied with the
               location of the school. There were one hundred and seventy teachers from New
               Brunswick&#8212;an unprecedented number&#8212;at the session in Campbellton in 1899,<note
                  target="n10.73" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">73</hi>
               </note> but only thirty at Bear River the next year and only fourteen at Lunenburg in
               1901. Eventually various circumstances, including the popularity of the newer summer
               courses for manual training, household science, and school gardening, affected the
               attendance, and the school was discontinued while the first World War was in
               progress. For over twenty years it had added to the knowledge and skill of hundreds
               of maritime teachers, and, in addition, had stood as a fine example of
               inter-provincial co-operation.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">An interesting example of a plea for science from a prominent teacher of
               the province during the heyday of the Summer School of Science may be found in the
               tenor and content of a paper written by Philip Cox and read before the Northumberland
               County Teachers' Institute in 1893. Having referred to <q rend="inline"

               development, this educator declared: <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified"
                  TEIform="q">Our children must be led to examine the facts and laws of life and

            <p TEIform="p">In the same year, in a paper on School Physics presented at the Saint
               John County Teachers' Institute, W. J. S. Myles contended that physics was the one
               science subject that would do more than any other to meet the demands of the
               industrial interests of the country and at the same time furnish mental training and
               culture. Teachers, he said, must awaken to the fact that hundreds of the boys of the
               province were looking forward to careers as electrical, mechanical and sanitary
               engineers, and to industrial positions, in all of which a greater or less knowledge
               of physics was indispensable. Referring to the new laboratory at McGill and to the
               more modest measures at the provincial uni- <pb n="249" id="p249" TEIform="pb"/>
               versity, the speaker pointed out that the colleges looked to the schools to furnish
               the preliminary steps in giving students a slight knowledge of the methods of <q

                  in our curriculum today, because we live in what may be termed the age of

            </p>

            <p TEIform="p">Occasionally even the trustee boards of urban schools made particular

               </note> The Superintendents of Education, each in turn, emphasized the importance of
               observation and investigation, reminded teachers to make collections of specimens,
               lamented the limited work done by the secondary schools, commended the Summer School
               of Science, and gave attention to the question of science texts. The curriculum of
               the schools, if one might judge by the prescribed books, offered an imposing and
               lengthening list of science courses in the advanced grades, botany, geology, nautical
               astronomy, physics, physiology and hygiene, and elementary chemistry, and in the
               lower grades, nature study, the chemistry of common things, lessons in health and
               agriculture, and the study of <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q"
                  >useful knowledge</q>. But one must not be misled by all this. It should be borne
               in mind that the teachers who attended the Summer School of Science and listened at
               the institutes to addresses and discussions on the importance of science were a
               decided minority, and that there were hundreds of districts, especially in rural
               areas, where neither the teachers nor the people cared a whit about the acquisition
               of scientific knowledge, or strove for the scientific approach to any subject.
               Actually, in only a few of the larger centres were there the qualified teachers, the
               equipment, and the demand, to render possible the extensive work in science which the
               prescribed texts indicated might be carried out. It would appear, moreover, that much
               which purported to be instruction in science was badly taught. Speaking from the
               standpoint of the grammar schools, Myles, in the paper we have already noted, even
               ventured to say that the claim that the New Brunswick school system ranked among the
               most progressive was not tenable, if it were viewed in the light of modern methods of
               science teaching. He declared that in not one high school of the province was
               experimental physics taught, and added: <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified"
                  TEIform="q">Much of our physics teaching appeals entirely to the memory, some to
                  memory and observation, very little, if any, to observation and

               these had created more misapprehension among teachers and more hostility among
               parents than any other subject. He found that while some teachers had made
               collections of plants, woods, and minerals, and had used these to excite thought and
               to promote enquiry, others merely required their pupils to memorize lists of plants
               and minerals with <pb n="250" id="p250" TEIform="pb"/> their uses and qualities.<note

            <p TEIform="p">We see, therefore, that over against the keen appreciation by a few of
               the meaning of science in a modern world there were confused ideas, and unwillingness
               or inability, because of lack of knowledge and training, to harmonize practices and
               attitudes with the new forces of science. Certainly agriculture and forest
               maintenance continued to suffer all too much during these years from unscientific and
               haphazard methods, and a scientific spirit was often lacking in the consideration of
               problems involving the preservation and restoration of physical and mental health. In
               other words, to return to our metaphor of an earlier page, the ocean tide had as yet
               only created ripples on the surface of the creek.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">Another outstanding characteristic of the last decades of the nineteenth
               century was the growth of political and social democracy. In the United States the
               north had triumphed over the aristocratic south, and in many countries, notably
               Britain, the social-democratic forces set in motion by the Industrial Revolution were
               working a change in society and government. New Brunswick, founded in reaction
               against the American Revolution, had missed the early democratic impulse, and, not
               being highly industrialized, did not suffer from those evils which hastened the
               growth of democracy in England and made its achievement somewhat tumultuous. The
               development of responsible government had been slow and comparatively unspectacular,
               the popular attitude towards municipal institutions had been one of indifference, the
               struggle for a democratic school system was protracted, and the movement to abolish
               the Legislative Council, the existence of which robbed responsible government of half
               its fruits, lacked urgency and force. Eventually, as we have seen, responsible
               government and a free school system were achieved. During the last quarter of the
               century the establishment of municipal institutions became compulsory and the
               Legislative Council was abolished-although more, perhaps, for economic, than for
               political and social reasons. Progress in the extension of the suffrage was cautious,
               even slow, the basis of the franchise remaining practically the same from 1855 to
               1889. In the latter year, during the Blair regime, a bill was passed which
               practically granted manhood suffrage.<note target="n10.81" anchored="yes"
                  TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">81</hi>
               </note> It stopped, however, at votes for women. Even an amendment to give the
               franchise to widows and spinsters of property was defeated. The right of women who
               owned property to vote at municipal elections and at school meetings, and to act as
               school trustees, was, however, conceded, but not without opposition. In 1886, when
                  <pb n="251" id="p251" TEIform="pb"/> William Pugsley sponsored a measure to permit
               women to become school trustees, one member of the legislature, E. L. Wetmore,
               objected on the score that school meetings were often disorderly, sticks and
               fence-poles being used by contending parties. On this remark a voice from the
               Assembly cried: <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">Let the women use
                  the broomsticks</q>. Wetmore declared that the bill was really the entering wedge
               of woman suffrage, and John McAdam of St. Stephen said that he would rather fail to
               win an election than depend on the votes of his wife and daughters.<note

               1896, when the Honorable H. R. Emmerson successfully promoted a bill to provide for

               </note> From 1885 to the close of the century the question of the franchise for women
               in provincial elections came up repeatedly. In 1894 there were petitions signed by
               over 10,000 persons,<note target="n10.84" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">84</hi>
               </note> and again in 1899 the question prompted a further solicitation. The plea of
               the petitioners was ably supported in the House by such men as A. A. Stockton and
               Silas Alward of Saint John, H. R. Emmerson of Dorchester, James Porter of Andover, A.
               A. Killam of Moncton, H. H. Pitts of Fredericton and M. C. Atkinson of Bristol.
               Premier A. G. Blair, on the other hand, consistently showed himself an opponent of
               this reform. A few statements culled from the debates on the subject will illustrate
               the growth of the democratic idea, may charm with their naiveté, and will illuminate
               the character of the legislatures which during these same years hesitated to take

               </note> Porter expressed the same view. The constitution, he said, professed to be by

               livelihood, and in the teaching profession outnumbered men four to one, but were
               generally paid not much more than half the salaries men received for doing the same
               work. He felt, he said, that if women had the vote, the sentiment of the country with
               respect to the compensation which they should receive would be changed, and that in
               the light of common sense it should be.<note target="n10.94" anchored="yes"

            <p TEIform="p">In the course of the discussions, inevitably the Queen was mentioned a
               number of times, various members pointing out that if the head of the empire was a

            <p TEIform="p">The expanding political democracy of the period affected only slightly
               the field of industrial relations. To begin with, prevailing lip service to the
               dignity of labor, natural enough in a country where the majority of people had to
               work with their hands, saved the working classes to a great extent from finding in a
               crushing sense of social inferiority an incentive to action in their own interests.
               In a province of limited capital, modest industrial enterprises, and many manual
               workers, the gap between the capitalist and the labourer was naturally less
               pronounced than in the great industrial areas of Britain and the <pb n="254"
                  id="p254" TEIform="pb"/> United States. Then too, only a fraction of the workers
               of the province were the employees of others, and when so employed, they were often
               seasonal employees only. Consequently the organization of labor groups for the
               acquisition or protection of rights could proceed but slowly. Moreover, while
               agriculture and capital had their representatives and their ardent supporters in the

            <p TEIform="p">A corollary of the doctrine of democratic government is the conception of
               the state's obligation to educate its citizens.<note target="n10.113" anchored="yes"

               </note> By the Act of 1871 the province of New Brunswick had accepted that
               obligation. In 1881 Superintendent Rand stated that back of the common school course
               of the province was the assumption that the public school was an agency for the
               general education of all classes, and was designed to impart a common education
               useful to all and open to all.<note target="n10.114" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </note> But there was still a long way to go before the educational system of New
               Brunswick could approach that modern ideal of democracy in education enunciated by
               Reisner as follows: <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">Ideally
                  considered, democracy in education implies generous opportunity for every child,
                  in spite of social distinctions and economic handicaps, to profit by educational
                  opportunities that will enable him to develop his ability as far as possible to
                  the ultimate advantage of himself and of society. It implies further, that the
                  internal economy of the school is to be such that each child may discover his best
                  capacities and may find the means of developing them; and, finally, it means that
                  the objective of school practices is the increase of intelligence in the pupil
                  about everyday situations and the growth in power to meet the problems of
                  citizenship in a critically intelligent spirit.</q>

               </note>
            </p>


            <p TEIform="p">In the light of this definition the school system of New Brunswick fell
               far short of democracy. Many schools were small, ugly, and poorly equipped; many were
               staffed by untrained or inexperienced teachers who lacked culture, vision and a
               knowledge of child psychology. Thus the internal economy of many schools failed to
               provide the atmosphere in which children could discover and develop their abilities,
               and could grow in intelligence and power. Moreover, although in theory the system
               offered educational opportunities for all, local <pb n="255" id="p255" TEIform="pb"/>
               indifference in many areas prevented the establishment of schools. If the people have
               a right to self-government, they have also a duty to qualify themselves for the
               exercise of government.<note target="n10.116" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">116</hi>
               </note> It would seem that many of the citizens of New Brunswick failed to accept the
               obligation to make the most of themselves through such educational facilities as were
               provided. In 1890 Superintendent Crocket stated that 25% of the children of the
               province between five and fifteen years of age were deriving no benefit from the
               school system,<note target="n10.117" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">117</hi>
               </note> and in 1895, according to the Honorable James Mitchell, the average
               attendance of the pupils enrolled was only 56%.<note target="n10.118" anchored="yes"
                  TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">118</hi>
               </note> If the people were negligent in this matter, so was the Legislature.
               Superintendent Crocket pointed out in 1891 that he had repeatedly urged on the
               Legislature the need of a compulsory attendance law, that the Inspectors had referred
               time and again to the increasing feeling in favor of such a provision, that many
               urban boards of trustees in their annual reports<note target="n10.119" anchored="yes"
                  TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">119</hi>
               </note> had given expression to the opinion that nothing short of a compulsory
               measure would secure the full benefits of the system, and that the press of the
               province had over and over again argued in favor of enforced attendance. If, he
               asked, the power of the government to secure the education of every child was not
               inherent in the Act of 1871, on what principle of right or reason had the state the
               authority to tax all persons and property for the support of the public schools. This
               is only one example of the many strong statements on this subject coming from the
               Chief Superintendent and Inspectors, who also seldom failed to mention the existence
               of compulsory school laws in other countries. The Legislature, however, continued to
               postpone action throughout the nineteenth century, and when in 1905 a compulsory
               school measure was enacted, the optional nature of the law robbed it of much of its
               efficacy.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">In addition to the children who received a deficient education, or none
               at all, because of the stupidity and indifference of parents and legislators, there
               were others whose unfortunate economic circumstances prescribed narrow limits to
               their schooling. The influence of the economic factor was recognized, of course, but
               the province lacked utopian socialists and economic realists. There was no one to
               speak after the fashion of Horace Greeley, a friend of the labor movement in the
               United States, who expressed the belief that before education could become what it
               should and must be, the social life whence it proceeded, whither it tended, should be
                  reformed.<note target="n10.121" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">121</hi>
               </note> The fact that poverty limited the education of so many children was perhaps a
               matter of regret to many thoughtful individuals; to others it almost appeared as a
               divine dispensation to enable the ambitious poor to show the stuff of which they were
               made. With the exception of a few scholarships leading to the provincial university,
               no aid was made available for the poor individual. The district of very low valuation
               received special <pb n="256" id="p256" TEIform="pb"/> aid from the government for the
               building of schoolhouses and for the maintenance of a minimum of education. That so
               many districts were classed as <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q"
                  >poor</q> districts was largely due to the arrangements whereby the province was
               divided for school purposes into small units in order to arouse local pride and a
               sense of local responsibility. Rand himself as we have seen, regarded the arrangement
               as a temporary one.<note target="n10.122" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </note> In 1885 Inspector Dole urged the abolition of all existing small districts,
               with their petty local machinery, and complained that his views on this subject in a

               evils of the multiplicity of small districts, to recommend the policy of
               consolidation, and to point to the benefits of consolidation in various American
               states and in Australia.<note target="n10.124" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               </note> In 1900 the Superintendent called on the Board of Education to consolidate
               arbitrarily small contiguous districts, in view of the fact that in June 1899 there
               were 490 districts where the average school attendance was less than 12, seventy-six
               of which had an average attendance of less than 6. He added that he had little hope
               of the adoption of consolidation in New Brunswick so long as the matter was left to
               the votes of ratepayers at the annual school meetings.<note target="n10.126"

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">126</hi>
               </note> Events proved the accuracy of his judgment. A few consolidated schools were
               established early in the twentieth century under the impetus of Sir William
               Macdonald's scheme for the introduction of manual training. After that, for forty
               years, local rivalries, inertia, and a fear of change conspired to prevent the
               extension of consolidation as part of the New Brunswick school system. Even a
               suggestion to increase the county fund from thirty cents to fifty cents per head, in
               order further to relieve poor districts and to offset inequality of assessments, went
               down before a storm of protest.<note target="n10.127" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

            <p TEIform="p">If it was true that the elementary education of the province was not
               completely democratic, in that not all the children of the province could take
               advantage of the opportunities for education, those opportunities often being
               exceedingly unequal, it was still more true that the secondary education of the
               province required a democratic extension. The increase of high school facilities was
               in accord with the spirit of the age. England, forced to recognize the superiority in
               industry and invention of the Germans, extended and modernized her system of
               secondary education during these years, and high schools were multiplied in the
               United States and in Ontario. Scarcely any subject gave the educators of New
               Brunswick greater concern that the state of those venerable institutions, the county
               grammar schools. By the Act of 1871 the grammar school boards might unite with the
               common school boards, and some of them did. However, for geographical and economic
               reasons the great majority of the children of a county could not attend grammar
               schools. d'Avray's suggestion <pb n="257" id="p257" TEIform="pb"/> of scholarships
               from the common schools to the high schools had been ignored. Moreover, with a few
               exceptions, the grammar and superior schools of the province could furnish no
               guarantee of adequate secondary instruction, for many of them filled the place and
               did the work of district schools.<note target="n10.128" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               and in 1891 he said that while other institutions had been remodelled to meet modern
               requirements, the grammar schools were just about where they had been three
               generations before.<note target="n10.131" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               the county at Shediac received $ 350, yet had no pupils beyond grade eight the first
               term and only 8 the second term. Obviously, the secondary education of the province
               needed over-hauling.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">We noted earlier that there were people in the province who denied the
               duty of the state to provide for free secondary education. Others, seeing that few
               children could take advantage of such education, complained that it benefited only
               the <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">classes</q>, and declared, not
               without reason, that much of the money devoted to secondary education was wasted.
               Many also complained that the secondary education which was provided did not meet the
               needs of the majority of the pupils. Of such complaints we note one in the form of a
               letter published in the New Brunswick Journal of Education in 1886. The writer of
               this letter stated: <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified" TEIform="q">For the larger
                  scholars of the Province there are no inducements to continue at school.
                  Especially those who do not intend or are not able to take a college course . . .
                  . This is not right. It is not in the best interests of the Province.
                  Three-quarters of the male pupils intend or are forced to become tillers of the
                  soil. Now, Mr. Editor, for this large number of pupils what provision is made?</q>

            <p TEIform="p">Perhaps because of lack of unanimity of views on the question of
               secondary education reforms were typically belated or piecemeal in character.
               Possibly the monopolistic spirit of favored localities and groups proved the leading
               obstacle. There was considerable opposition from Saint John in 1884 to the measure
               which rendered compulsory the dissolution of the old grammar school <pb n="258"

               to draw a grant from the University of New Brunswick and became the York County
               Grammar School. Areas in which grammar schools had been maintained for decades with
               small expense to the locality objected to the transfer of their grammar schools to
               more suitable points. As Superintendent Inch intimated in 1896, the residents of such
               localities regarded any change as an infringement of vested interests.<note

               unification of the whole educational system from grade one to the university, and
               improved both grammar and superior schools. Higher standards were exacted with
               reference to equipment, enrolment of pupils, extent and quality of work done, and in
               1895 special financial aid encouraged the employment in grammar schools of more than
               one teacher holding a grammar school license and doing grammar school work. High
               school entrance examinations were established, also Grammar School leaving and
               University Matriculation examinations, and in 1898 a new course of instruction for
               high schools was ratified. In 1900 Superintendent Inch could report that the number
               of pupils receiving instruction in the high school grades had increased 150% from
               1891 to 1899.<note target="n10.137" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

            <p TEIform="p">In the course of instruction the emphasis continued to be on the
               traditional studies, although the Chief Superintendents in turn often spoke of the
               demands of modern times, and there were complaints from a number of quarters that the
               secondary education of the province seemed designed to serve the select few who
               planned to attend the university. The expense which changes would involve seemed a
               weighty factor and the force of tradition was strong. Then, too, those parents who
               were able to give their children a college education generally showed the greatest
               interest in the schools, and were the most influential persons. Finally, the mass of
               the people were slow to speak and the legislature was slow to act. Thus it was only
               at the very close of the century that there was a move toward the inclusion of manual
               training, domestic science, and business subjects in the curricula of the high
               schools of the province.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">A democratic society, aiming at the good of all, recognizes the
               importance of the welfare of the individual, and is concerned with questions of
               health-physical, mental, and moral. In 1897 Stockton, reviewing in the New Brunswick
               legislature the sixty years of Victoria's reign, referred to the great advances
               during that period in almost everything that tended to uplift and enoble humanity and
               to humanize the economic and sanitary conditions of the people. At no previous time,

            <p TEIform="p">With the establishment of local Boards of Health and the wider use of
               vaccination, New Brunswick during these years sought to improve the health of its
               people and to ward off the terrible epidemics which periodically in the earlier days
               had caused a heavy loss of life and efficiency. In relation to education, the
               increased interest in public health promoted an emphasis on the ventilation and
               sanitary arrangements of schools, and led to the introduction into the curriculum of
               lessons on health and temperance. We find that schools were now regularly closed by
               the boards of health at any threat of an infectious or contagious disease, a wise
               precaution certainly, but one which worked hardship to the teachers of the province,
               until in 1894 the Board of Education sanctioned the payment to teachers of that
               portion of their government grant lost when their schools were closed by the Board of

               Mullin to apply in 1885 to the Board of Education for the appointment of a medical

                  developments of the plumber's art</q> was efficient enough, and that the

            <p TEIform="p">During these years the Provincial Asylum received a good deal of
               attention in the legislature. The management of the institution was frequently
               questioned, but invariably from the standpoint of cost of operation. When the
               government leaders expressed pride, as the Hon. James Mitchell did in 1892,<note

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">144</hi>
               </note> over the fact that the asylum cost less per capita for maintenance than any
               institution of the kind, public or private, in America, few members of the
               legislature felt called on to question this state of affairs as a source of
               gratification.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">The province was slow to undertake measures to combat delinquency and to
               aid physical defectives. In 1893, largely through the generosity and <pb n="260"

               or deaf mutes. For a number of years, the school for the deaf and dumb at Fredericton
               and a similar institution at Halifax urged the government of New Brunswick for
               assistance, as pupils from that province attended these institutions and frequently
               were unable to pay anything for their training. Finally the school at Halifax refused
               to accept New Brunswick pupils unless the government followed the example of Nova
               Scotia in giving a grant for each pupil in attendance from the province.<note

               </note> In 1892 the legislature passed an act by which the Fredericton school for
               deaf mutes was to receive from the County School Fund a grant of $ 60 per year for
               every child from New Brunswick in attendance at the school. A somewhat similar
               provision was made for the education of blind children at the Halifax School for the
                  Blind.<note target="n10.147" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">147</hi>
               </note> Small though these grants were, they proved an added strain on the County

            <p TEIform="p">Retarded pupils and mental defectives were still unprovided for when the

               having suggested in 1892 the establishment of a kindergarten department in connection
               with the Normal School, but the overcrowding of the building had led to the
               abandonment of the scheme.<note target="n10.152" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">

               system of New Brunswick, such schools of that nature being private institutions.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">From the standpoint of pedagogy the growth of democracy in the last half
               of the nineteenth century led to considerable interest in the psychology of the
               child, and in the best methods of teaching. Judging from the official reports, the
               Superintendents of Education in New Brunswick and the Inspectors were conversant with
               the theories of the great educators of their own and an earlier day. At the Normal
               School student-teachers received at least a brief exposure to the latest pedagogical
               theories. When the period of training was extended in 1871, Principal Crocket said
               that hitherto the lives and principles of distinguished educators such as Pestalozzi
               and Arnold had been little more than alluded to, but that the extension of the term
               would henceforth allow the <pb n="261" id="p261" TEIform="pb"/> student-teachers an
               opportunity to devote more time to professional work.<note target="n10.153"

                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">153</hi>
               </note> We note that to the list of texts for teachers the Board of Education in 1887
               added the following: Fitch's Lectures on Teaching, Payne's Science and Art of
               Education, Browning's Educational Theories, and, for grammar school teachers, Sully's
               Outlines of Psychology. Evidence that the Inspectors were interested in the teachers'
               attitudes toward their profession is found in a number of reports, of which the
               following are examples. In 1887 Inspector Mersereau said that the teachers of the
               Institute for Northumberland and Gloucester Counties had unanimously adopted Payne's
               Science and Art of Teaching for reading during the year, and for discussion at
               subsequent meetings.<note target="n10.155" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">155</hi>
               </note> In 1884 Inspector Oakes reported in disgust that many teachers were
               unacquainted with professional literature. He had found those who had never read,
               never even heard of, Calkin's Object Lessons, or Herbert Spencer on Education. Far
               too many, he lamented, made no effort to put into practice the principles they had
               learned at the Normal School, seldom attended an institute, or read a book or journal
               on education.<note target="n10.156" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">156</hi>
               </note> The fact that the New Brunswick Journal of Education, and later the
               Educational Review, with which the Journal merged in 1887, received very limited
               patronage from the teaching profession of the province bears testimony to the truth
               of Inspector Oakes' observations.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">The Superintendents frequently discussed the practices of other
               countries, and the teachers, through the Summer School of Science, and an occasional
               convention, such as that held at St. Stephen in joint session with the teachers of
                  Maine,<note target="n10.157" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">157</hi>

               </note> gained a few interesting contacts with the teachers of adjacent states and
               provinces. The eventual extension of the Normal School session to one year made
               possible a greater degree of professional training, but the limited staff of the
               institution, the lack of space in the Model School, and the necessity of teaching
               academic subjects to the student-teachers, all combined to set definite limits to the
               amount of actual training in professional work. Invariably, the Superintendent of
               Education and the Principal of the Normal School stressed the need of facilities for
               a more adequate professional training.<note target="n10.159" anchored="yes"

               </note> Friction among the members of the staff of the Normal School in 1899, which
               reached such a point that one member of the faculty struck another, brought on an
               investigation. The Commissioners appointed for the purpose not only enquired into the
               strained relations which had existed for some time between the Principal and the
               teaching staff, but also probed into the methods pursued by the staff. Having found
               that only about one-fifth of the school time was taken up with instruction in method
               and professional work, and the other four-fifths was devoted to such ordinary
               scholastic work as ought to be obtained in any superior or grammar school, the <pb
                  n="262" id="p262" TEIform="pb"/> Commissioners called for a reorganization of the
               Normal School with a view to securing more training in professional work than was

               annual report, had strongly emphasized the need of better facilities to provide more
               practice teaching, and had expressed the hope that the day was not far distant when
               the strength of the Normal School would be expended in securing to its teachers a
               sound theoretical and practical acquaintance with education, its principles and its

               extension to a year and a half of the course for first class teachers, and the
               gradual reorganization of entrance requirements, so that eventually the teaching of
               academic subjects at the Normal School might be entirely eliminated, and full
               attention given to purely professional training.<note target="n10.162" anchored="yes"

               </note> In 1901 the Board of Education raised the age of entrance to seventeen and
               increased the requirements for admission. The Superintendent said, however, that
               since few persons were willing to spend two years at the Normal School, unless the
               prospects of financial reward were brighter, the further extension of the Normal
               session was impossible, and the only practicable course was to continue the teaching
               of both academic and professional subjects, so as to improve both scholarship and
               professional knowledge and skill.<note target="n10.163" anchored="yes" TEIform="note">
                  <hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">163</hi>
               </note> We observed earlier that forty years passed before the practical suggestions
               of the first Principal of the Normal School were carried out. Another period of four
               decades has passed since New Brunswick's educationists, at the close of the
               nineteenth century, hoped for the early establishment of a two-year Normal course.
               Even after allowance is made for the effect of two wars, and other factors, this
               delay is surely unduly long.</p>


            <p TEIform="p">Among the educational displays from New Brunswick at various exhibitions
               during this period was one shown at the Indian and Colonial Exhibition held in London
               in 1886. After viewing this exhibit, William Lant Carpenter, an English educationist
               who was interested in the condition of education in the <q rend="inline"

               elementary education was not yet completely free, so that in this respect the New
               Brunswick system might indeed seem impressive by comparison. Moreover, the exhibit,
               although accompanied by an historical sketch of the development of education in New
               Brunswick, could not present an altogether accurate picture of actual conditions and
               practices. Undoubtedly, however, this <pb n="263" id="p263" TEIform="pb"/> particular
               British educationist was impressed by the evidence he saw. The following tribute from
               the New England Journal of Education in 1881 was also gratifying to Superintendent
               Rand. Referring to the prescribed course of instruction for the schools of New
               Brunswick, this educational journal said: <q rend="inline" direct="unspecified"

               </note> The request from South Africa at the close of the Boer War that Principal
               Mullin of the Normal School, and a number of other New Brunswick teachers, should be
               given leave of absence to journey to South Africa and there lay the foundation of a
               school system along the principles of the system in New Brunswick appeared as lively
               proof of the excellence of the New Brunswick system. Today the general belief seems
               to be that the educational services of the Maritime Provinces are of an inferior
               grade, a belief which has found expression in a number of Maritime briefs. Indeed,
               the lesson of history is surely that institutions, however well devised they may be
               at the time of their inception, require constant modification in the light of new
               needs, as humanity adapts itself to the eternal flux of things. Societies that
               attempt to remain static inevitably perish. It was a healthy sign that the defects
               that appeared in New Brunswick's educational system were becoming very evident to
               many observers at the close of the nineteenth century. Unfortunately not all the old
               defects and deficiencies have yet been corrected. Moreover, the task of remodelling,
               a task which in a sense must be continuous, has had many checks and postponements. It
               is scarcely possible, however, that those whose duty it is to build and rebuild in
               the present and immediate future will have to face obstacles, difficulties, and
               vexations any greater than those which confronted the pioneer builders of the
               past.</p>
